<p>9.00 AM..Thursday,10th Sep.2009....</p>
<p>BOOM !!!</p>
<p>2 tall Software engineers were dumb-founded to see a long queue of a
kilometer outside the gates before it wasn't a sunrise for the bank !
Reason ? Some national level competition forms were out and these
hopefuls wanted to grab a copy of it. Such kind of rushes were only seen
outside a dominant nationalized / private bank ATM here to draw money or
outside a lone eatery in the neighborhood. Seeing the maddening rush,
they decided to join at the end on a hope. But they had skipped office
and feared their managers would screw them up for late arrival.
Eventually they had to risk it as they were many reasons for it..
Company colleagues were out for breakfast, managers' vehicles zoomed
past this bank and a doubt that they wouldn't receive their forms was a
big point of concern. Looking at the sky, closing their eyes, they
joined in hiding their faces out from the crowd as if a thief was hiding
from the police right in front of them !</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the company colleagues were joining at the back,
unaware for these 2 idiots. After sometime, they were shocked after they
approached them to fill their forms too ! What a meanly attitude, but to
these guys' surprise, they were quite convinced as they cant open their
mouths in front of our bosses !</p>
<p>After 2 hours of literal bathing under the hot sun, our dumbos got their
receipts, faces like that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni after winning a
Cricket World Cup !!</p>
<p>Gosh.. What a day it was.. Guess, such rush was a daily visual out
here.. You can find many such ones right now going out in Bangalore at
the least ! Just walk near your bank and see for yourself !</p>
