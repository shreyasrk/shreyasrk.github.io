cannot be forgotten. Or not made to. An oasis in a mirage of hopes and
thoughts in a desert of laid back human resources.</p>
</p><p>On my visit to a career fair in my university, I was eager to catch a
glimpse of the new companies that had few to work, but tons of it. No
biasing here. But the MNC stalls just didn't make me interested. After
catching few persons of this nature of work and their demand, I was
caught in attention by a tall, white, half-bald person who was with a
MacBook and a stool as his stall. He had this gleam of passion in his
eyes and the body language was just supporting it. Dressed in casual
shirt and jeans, he then began his short speech. Err.. Introduction, I
mean.</p>
<p>He was the Chief Technology Officer of the company that he was
campaigning for and had flew all the way to Singapore from the US. Just
to meet passionate people. Just that! Other stalls were of the regular
nature of asking your technical skills and the monotonous nonsense which
wasn't worth for.</p>
<p>But not this fellow. He was of the opinion that as long as you want to
grow as a developer, technical skills doesn't matter. Be it Ruby, Java
or Python. A beginner, novice or an expert. Related or unrelated to the
nature of work. As long as you know what it takes to remain as a
developer. The study, rigorous practice and explorations that cannot be
imagined. He had this unique feature to convince people through the
style of work he has done and that simple thing of saying a lot but in a
completely jovial manner.</p>
<p>The person's name? Andy Croll. Of ImpulseFlyer. Check out the
<a class="reference external" href="https://impulseflyer.com/">*website*</a> to know what I was portraying.
What made me his fan was <a class="reference external" href="http://andycroll.com/2012/02/22/hello-future-engineers/">this
post</a>. A
recommended read. Share and be inspired! And yes, do read his other
posts. You might just be on the verge of joining him one day.</p>
