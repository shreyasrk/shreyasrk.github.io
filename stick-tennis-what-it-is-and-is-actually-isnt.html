</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>How often do you wind off your routine to crash into that couch and play
some games to cool yourself? I check out Stick Tennis quite often and
went to a level quite unbelievable in work.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It isn't about the game as such but is rather, much more than that. It teaches you how to work and excel. Some that I found are:</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1. Focus, focus and pure focus.</div>
<div class="line">2. Don't be aware of your ongoing progress at that instinct when you've to deliver. Just give your best shot. Don't care about anything else.</div>
<div class="line">3. Know your rules perfectly. A game improperly known is a game improperly played.</div>
<div class="line">4. Know your opponent carefully. Study his movements and his working patterns.</div>
<div class="line">5. Always be aware of surprises.</div>
<div class="line">6. Don't take anything to heart. You always have an extra set to prove your meddle if you lose the first one.</div>
<div class="line">7. It is okay to lose, too! You cannot be a winner all the time.</div>
<div class="line">8. Compete against the best. Always. And yes, compete.</div>
<div class="line">9. A calm mind will give the best of results. Don't panic in any situation.</div>
<div class="line">10. Be aware of your over-confidence going above the zero limit during the game. That snatches your winning chances. If you cannot control, breath hard and shout &quot;Shut up&quot; to yourself. That helps.</div>
<div class="line">11. Fine-tune your strengths. Weaknesses take time.</div>
<div class="line">12. Keep a very low margin of error. But keep extending your limits on boundaries.</div>
<div class="line">13. Make sure your game is sportive rather than personal vengeance.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Play the game and excel in &quot;World Domination&quot;. That's one game to not
miss out. The difficulty level rises sharply after every level, and so
your game changes too.</p>
