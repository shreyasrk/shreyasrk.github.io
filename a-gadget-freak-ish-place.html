</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Singapore was never this much expected. Not from me atleast. Singapore
is quite a decent and crowdless societal country where in there are
loads of parks, gardens and footpaths to walk, but no pedestrians to see
at all. Also people are so much busy in hurrying to their work that they
never get time to live !</p>
<p>These might be just a glimpse of the developed worlds. Heard from my
peers that this situation exists in every rich country that is
economically developed. You would never find people around, just the
beautifully scad trees brushed with tall buildings in the background
with eyes and necks difficult to focus to the top floors. The clean
roads and lights which the traffic never tries to skip over. It is also
ruled by money, with hefty fines all around, be it for a trivial rule
offence like chewing gum ! But the point here lies with the people that
fill this country.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why there are 40 storey housing apartments all over
this country, a size less than half of the present Bangalore yet
generating billions of dollars of income and revenues from varied
aspects of the economy. Are they actually filled with people who rush to
their work, for the betterment of Singapore ? Why are there lush
surroundings and greenery filled with trees, parks and what not for the
same people for enjoyment or relaxation ? Why there is no other life
than work and home for these people ? Do you see any other person out
here other than yourself in the mirror sometimes ?</p>
<p>But until it proved wrong today for the mega event of the year that most
of Singaporeans wait for. It was the annual IT fair, 2011 that I am
referring to similar to Bangalore's legendary IT shows. This was held at
Suntec City, close to Marina Bay, Singapore. By far, I have never ever
seen such a huge crowd of people, ever! People of all sorts, old, young,
fat, lean, tall, short, kids and parents. It looked like an old market
place back home where we used to visit often in a week to buy some
cheaper items. Seeing this, I have to admit, that market place is
nowhere compared to what I was seeing today. Tons and tons of electronic
gadgets waiting for these hungry, gadget-freaky Singaporeans to snatch
and fight to take them back home. There was not a single global company
to miss out for booking their profits in whatever they were placing on
their shelves in their stores. The last day of the event it was, for had
to be bigger and better, so it was arranged in this mall, a size three
time to that of our Bangalore malls and storeys mounting in 6-7 levels
of goods !</p>
<p>Not withstanding the craziness, a friend took a laptop at a price not
worth mentioning here. But one thing I saw was that at least there is
life in Singapore or you get to see one when you tempt them with an
electronic gadget ! ;-)</p>
