</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><p>Now, if I say that again and again that it is a personal phase that I'm
writing about every time, you might want to stop reading this. As this
is what is going on currently apart from Twitter, Gmail and
movies-on-loop.</p>
</p><p>But, anyway, let's continue. As I don't want to start a new argument of
my existential phase and the reason of me giving lecture each and every
moment. I told you, I could be a professor someday. Looks like that
phase is somewhat approaching nearer.</p>
<p>Wondering how? I was perplexed myself too when I got a call from a
Professor who was looking for Engineers in the line of research he was
going into. Strange as it may seem as of how did I manage, considering
the pathetic, bare minimum clearance of academics in my post-graduation,
a hell lot of other activities which weren't helpful for my benefit and
the tons of distractions on campus.</p>
<p>So, without thinking of anything else, as the phase of job search was
going through extreme vigour, the interview stage was set. The decider
came in, took a look at my created mess, admired and cleared, only to
find, after a couple of days, a mail in the inbox approving his
selection.</p>
<p>Man! If you taste success after a painful, continuous, wanting-to-end
type of stress, your hands starts to tremble. Your body begins to ache
all of a sudden and the eyes water out in a jiffy. You tend to call all
your near and dear ones to share the happiness. You tend to forget what
went through and what you achieved.You suddenly realize all that is
around is meaningless and immaterial to the inner soul of penance that
it gives which can turn out to be the most superior of all forces...</p>
<p>Bah. The above few lines were exaggerate, just like you tend to feel
when you watch a South Indian movie dialogue marathon. Anyway, lets
continue. The job line would be different, so as to what people are
saying, but as long as it gives me food, I won't mind. When you live in
an expensive country like Singapore, all you need is money to feed
yourself and money to pay for some place to stay peacefully.</p>
<p>I don't know what I scribbled, just wanted to keep this blog alive for
September as there were no posts and it was feeling lonely.</p>
<p>Okay. Bye.</p>
