</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><p>In the few months that went by, apart from getting exposed to the
fantastic world of Computing via some Google Groups and Social networks,
I happen to see one interesting trait. Of the very old falseness of the
people around. Too loud, yet hollow. Too big, yet too small in stature.
Too much of attitude, but plain dumb luck otherwise.</p>
</p><p>Of all the people I see around, I don't know why but this random fakes
try to dish out every possible platter on your menu. Everything you
need. or don't need to. Or just try to be in your lines for the sake of
it. I mean, how can you act in a way, that is not yourself?</p>
<p>What triggers them might be, is the quest of finding people with
qualities that they can only now dream of. Of the things that might look
interesting enough, but end up as a plain dumb episode with ad breaks
and no content. By God's *grace*, I came across many such groups
around and I should be thanking everyone of them, from whom, I stay away
from.</p>
<p>Take the simple example case of that lousy couple who might be the next
Curie thing on this earth. (Oh, for those who don't know, the Curie
couple have won a Nobel for their invention. Link found <a class="reference external" href="http://is.gd/7Dwlvf">here - &quot;One
rare couple&quot;</a>. ). Their intelligence wasn't
matching the level of arrogance. To add to this concern was to shout out
loud voices and irritating behavior which can even make a dead man
alive. Oh, not to forget, the obnoxious feeling they used to get when
they don't feel like talking to one is but sure, a demeaning feature.</p>
<p>Or another example of a group, which I met accidentally by chance. Or
rather, from a fake fellow. Once he sees a cute girl, he makes it a
point to just shove his ass off to them and dance with his body, naked,
if demanded. No doubt in being funny, but expecting the other party to
be one too and then ditching them just because they weren't your &quot;types&quot;
isn't cool.</p>
<p>Or the recent one, for example. This has to be described in detail. A
lean, short kid who has interests in football and nothing else starts
building up fake attitude when he sees his fellowmen. The same fellow,
who is pretty normal with his egoistic speeches and childishness around,
suddenly becomes a monster of falsehood. Of the similar types though!
Ranting about stuff is okay, but humiliating someone in front of others
is just a plain &quot;wannabe&quot;. Just that. What worse can it get? Ignoring
once or twice could be nice, but repeating the same trait is mere
stupidity. A counter-answer? It should be taunted back in straight
lines. Else, the advantages keep coming in and escalating.</p>
<p>Whoa! I should thank Singapore for introducing me such dumbfucks as this
is one phase of people, I didn't meet with. And the smartness of
ignoring them is the best thing that you could do. To yourself. To
yourself. And only, to yourself.</p>
