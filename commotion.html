I had been to a party place.&nbsp;Anticipation of&nbsp;highs, with dances and a
bewildered crowd&nbsp;crossed through the mind. Of all the places this was of
course, the most widely discussed, criticized and loved about.</p>
<p>To begin with, this was a planned arrangement ! I don't know why. It
really was, at least&nbsp;for some minds. It was a long time in Singapore and
I hadn't checked out the party place yet ! So gathered with a few newly
made&nbsp;pals and then were all dressed up for the fun event.&nbsp;I looked&nbsp;like
the&nbsp;plain old geeky nerd with a plain old casual shirt, jeans and a pair
of flip-flops, someone who thinks its cool, but actually it isn't.&nbsp;And
gracious me, I was in the university doing some nonsense stuff the very
same day and joined without a change.&nbsp;So, packed with a couple of
dollars and excitement, we arrived.</p>
<p>The place, an&nbsp;agglomeration with&nbsp;clogged bars, open-air chairs and
artificial trees. Not to forget, the popular live bands amidst the
cramped spaces. And not to forget the bridge setup and open spaces which
I dreamt of all the time to sit. We then went in search of&nbsp;one of our
pals&nbsp;who was already having a ball with his foreign chaps and to our
surprise, he was on high &quot;spirits&quot;. He finally caught up with us and
gulped a few more to his never-ending thirst. And the&nbsp;fun he cracked was
making me remind of my
<a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.6133333333,77.2083333333&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=28.6133333333,77.2083333333%20(India)&amp;t=h">Indian</a>
fellows back home, who went on a rampage of flocking around doing weird
things.</p>
<p>As nobody had dinner, we thought of having a quick snack at a local
store. To&nbsp;the surprise, after looking at the scenario across the entire
place and a LIVE cricket match, my hunger vanished. We then went back to
the bridge, and sat for a short talk before the real play. The bridge
was a&nbsp;platform made for the guzzlers, with large&nbsp;decks to sit on. And a
lake beneath, with a carcass&nbsp;of steps lining its boundaries to add to
the beauty. Emotions began to spurt out amidst the get-together talk,
with some highs and lows&nbsp;taking it to a memorable stage. And then was
more magical. It started to drizzle, just like you see in a movie.
Picture perfect, but actually turning out as a dampener which switched
the open-air event to a closed one, as more audiences&nbsp;jammed the tightly
crammed&nbsp;spaces, locked and helpless.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;we were all students looking for&nbsp;their wallets&nbsp;and the place is a
steep&nbsp;cutter on expenses part, we then barged into a club &nbsp;to save
ourselves from the waters&nbsp;and started to jig around. Not much as in a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-boying">break dance</a> fashion, but a
stationary one, grooving to the music from the live bands with just our
upper halves swirling around as it was a packed house. It was a
Scottish&nbsp;pub in a candlelight&nbsp;theme with&nbsp;sit-up chairs and sofa
sets&nbsp;as&nbsp;in an&nbsp;old&nbsp;era&nbsp;with no cover charges. The dance floor&nbsp;turned out
be a small platform where in at most of&nbsp;five persons&nbsp;can swing&nbsp;freely.
To our surprise, one of us was on a&nbsp;roll and was just jumping like a
spring all the place, whirling and&nbsp;hustling to the beats. A great fun to
watch people having a gala time, a&nbsp;first-time experience.</p>
<p>Returning back from the place was also scenic with roads being a treat
to watch in the night. One of the group&nbsp;members commented that it looked
exactly how our Indian counterpart resembled it, making me feel
home-sick for an instant.&nbsp;A cool breeze among the nature-clad roads in a
rented cab&nbsp;with a zephyr of water in the air from the roads made by the
transits finished the night with an ice-cream ! Crashing was&nbsp;in a
friend's <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory">dorm room</a>,&nbsp;a
minuscule piece to slop down but had not other way.</p>
<p>Guess this night will still be lingered about for some days to come.</p>
