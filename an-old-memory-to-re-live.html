</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Sometimes, why the time has to tick forward? Why should not it tick
backwards ? So that I could re-live those days again ?!!</p>
<p>Guess, this again, makes me hum the song, &quot;Give me some sunshine, Give
me some Rain; Give me another chance, I wanna grow up once again.......&quot;
from the movie, '3 idiots'. So hypothetical, but very true. This song
always pings me whenever I see my old Engineering photos in my computer.</p>
<p>Gosh, how quickly time flies ! It looks like just the other day, on the
first day of my Engineering Physics Lab, when I was doing some random
stuffs on the apparatus setup with another geek. God knows what it was,
but then it led me stand besides 2 chattering guys unknowingly.
Irritated on the first moment, I tried to stay away but then as time
advanced during the lab, became quite cool with that. But heck, I never
realized that those 2 guys were the starting bond of a terrific gang
that made waves in the department itself !!</p>
<p>This then advanced to sitting beside them the next day onwards, having
loads of chattering and talking nonsense (which looked quite sensible at
that time like canteen food , Kannada actresses, college chicks and a
few other silly stuff). This led to the growth of our gang by a few
more, I mean a couple of benches in the front and in the back. All types
of people, Short-tempered, maniacal, patient, dumb, intelligent and what
not. Slowly, we all bonded very well, the first step being going out for
a movie. I still remember the one called &quot;Lakshya&quot; of Farhan Akhtar for
which we all went after a tough semester exam. The joy, the pranks and
the fun we had was quite awesome. Then we all grew together, as if
staying in the same house; internals with a jolly mood, externals with
total seriousness and then goofing it up in the end; parties for each
and every occasion, be it for flunking in exams or a reason like coming
to college !</p>
<p>There was something unique, so peaceful and so much life in every moment
that you can try it even now. Just pass through a nearby college and you
shall get to know what I am conveying out here. See a couple or two ?
Now roll back to history and see for yourself. There is fun, seriousness
and a somewhat, &quot;student&quot; approach, totally absent of worldly
responsibilities, just like the smile of an innocent child and a
substance, somewhat divine and pure that you wont get anywhere else.</p>
<p>All this sounds normal now, but this was very much special for me. For
it was a complete opposite to what I was grown into ; in a meritorious,
competitive-edged and a dumb environment. All were total geeks, delved
into those 200 page text-books, having just eaten it up a thousand times
over and over. Nothing but study; no cricket, no time pass and no
outside eateries too ! Harsh thing was, I was kept aside by everyone
until I came face to face with a tragedy ! Sometimes, while going for
the counselling rounds, I used to curse god for giving me such bad luck,
but now he juxtaposed me to this totally whacky, out-of-this world
experience, which I would certainly cherish for a lifetime.</p>
<p>By the way, shall post about the department fun activities sometime
later. Chao !</p>
