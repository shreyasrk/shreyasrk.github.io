</footer><!-- /.post-info --><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><p>One thing that strikes is the way the mind thinks. A feeling
unquantifiable, relentless and serene. The right brain works in a way
difficult to comprehend and this is what makes the world beautiful and
demented at the same time - former for the artistic phenomenon and the
latter for the infinite loop it creates through people's connectivity.</p>
</p><p>To share a personal experience, some close pals wanted to start a coffee
outlet. The objective being the usual - different from other models and
of a brand value building. So, work began for the fundamentals - land
for the shop, bamboo furniture to lay in, talks with coffee bean dealers
and the menu listing. But, in the process of brand building, they forgot
the basic rule.</p>
<p>Of naming the outlet!&nbsp;At a casual meeting over a birthday treat of
<em>Samosas</em> and <em>chai</em>, we debated. Many names came into being - most of
them being the regular, off-beat ones which linked to only coffee and
the beans. Some suggested after looking out to other outlets as their
names deal with the size of the cup! A regular, boring list came up and
then the discussion was about to confine. But then, at the right most
point, when the argument heated up, came the ridiculousness and
astonishment.</p>
<p>The name I suggested, was that of the tagline which sounded like the
ones that I read about in some book grabbed in the store. Simply put, it
tagged that it wasn't another coffee point. Ignorant people quickly
found the name attractive and asked me about the main header. Suggestion
was to just acronym the tag line! Jealousy came in some, for the way the
name came up and happiness among one of the outlet founders. Adding this
to the list, we sailed to a nearby restaurant to dine.</p>
<p>I don't know why the name clicked but then the founders polled it to
console themselves. And thus, the brand came up. And now, is getting
expanded to four more outlets!</p>
<p>Was surprised how a small line can be a brand. I should have asked for
renumeration. The creative consultant, you see!</p>
