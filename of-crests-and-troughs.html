</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A circle for sure. That can be summarized for the year 2011. A year with
new hopes, new life and new horizons that was awaiting. With all the
past boredom, desire and monotonous life, this came as a new beginning.</p>
<p>To start with, I landed in the tourist, tiny country of the Republic of
Singapore. A country dazzling with greenery, skyscrapers and smooth
roads. With so much development around, visible in the standards of
airport, metro stations and mall culture, this was an eye-magnet. But
was on a mission, a goal rather, to continue my geeky dork inside. A
feat to continue studies made me land here by sheer coincidence. Rather
than continuing the &quot;Sheldon Cooper&quot;isms, the year continues.</p>
<p>Initial months were awestruck - by the fact of being exposed to a
different, actual style of learning. This astonishment lead to a down
slide of performance which can be credited to laziness, sleeping and
more of internet. The urge to returning steeped up with some offers to
interning back home. With some shocks from the professors about work, I
quit - It was not worth staying and working under a irresponsible,
baseless teacher who was wasting his time giving stupid lectures of
immeasurable amounts. Among this, threw up the results of a failed
semester - a feat impossible to believe. But I had to accept the reality
and kept quiet.</p>
<p>With so much confusions, the last few months became a delight. Some more
friends made the days pass by. With an interest to cook more delicacies,
I impressed myself. &nbsp;Books came back into life and reading habit shot
up. The tension of results steeped up and so was detachment from
everything for a month. Some seriousness finally gave in and the results
came pretty neat - slicing through the edge keeping the studies meter,
intact.</p>
<p>New year was an unexpected one. A surprise visit back home cheered up
family and close friends. Repeating the same routine of enjoyment, a
party in the end winded it up.</p>
<p>Now, another year awaits. With newer challenges - a job to save my soul,
and some good grades for a better life &nbsp;- this year shall be watched and
learnt.</p>
