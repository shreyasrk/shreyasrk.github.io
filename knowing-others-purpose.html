</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Recently, a friend of mine was chatting on GTalk and then came up with
the news that was quitting the company he was working in ! I immediately
thought of it, was a weird decision to quit in such bad times of
recession where people are ready to even stay in their company by doing
nothing or even, everything !! But, the real motto of his quitting was
not the usual one like greener pastures which everybody of us dream of.</p>
<p>He had found his real objective. The objective of being an expert in the
field of study he was interested in and contribute something to society
in terms of its values. The career plan and the advice that was
followed, for the first time, was scintillating ! He clearly explained,
how to make a life altering decision work for yourself, which would be
posted in a separate post though ! And whatever that follows, is merely
your decision, your choice, for which you aren't sad about and moreover,
this job thing and which follows that, looks crap, thereafter. They say
working on your dreams is the true satisfaction and I saw a live example
in my friend's form.</p>
