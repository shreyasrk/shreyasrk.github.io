</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><p>So, I finally landed up into watching a Chetan Bhagat adapted movie, yet
again. After the thoroughly edited &quot;3 Idiots&quot; which was a total tipsy
adaptation of &quot;Five Point Someone&quot;, here comes one more of Bhagat's
story-telling-masala-masterpiece saga.</p>
</p><p>Why is it that a movie adapted from a popular best seller always turns
out to be better than the book itself? Atleast, this is what the reviews
try to compel you. But the fact is, Bhagat's novel, &quot;The 3 mistakes of
my Life&quot; turns exactly the opposite to be. Well, for me at least. Looks
like a tweaked story of the original piece however.</p>
<p>Don't agree? Well, then let me begin with pointing out the three
mistakes of why I didn't &quot;laauve&quot; Kai Po Che. Three pals, Omi, Ishaan
and Govind, the best of pals, try to be something in their lives. Well,
we have seen much more closeness of the bonds in Dil Chahta Hai and Rock
On, but I'm still not able to figure out what made Bhagat, the
screenplay writer himself for this movie, turn the climax and the plot
around in parts!</p>
<p>The first mistake, Govind should have been the narrator. It is dumb to
show the plot going in a loose way which the narrator is the story
rather than the protagonist. Bhagat excelled this in the book. I mean,
if Govind did took sleeping pills and make his way to the deathbed and
then the actual &quot;friendship&quot; masala would've turned out sweeter, no?</p>
<p>The second mistake, the make-out scene. I mean, come on man! Boys die to
get that feel out of the narration how Govind explained in the book. How
he makes out with his disciple, despite Ishaan being at home. That
tensed nervousness, that emotional guilt and the passion that ignited
after the few classes he takes is missing. I mean, the Vidya shown in
the movie deserved a lot, lot more than how she opens up herself.</p>
<p>And the third mistake, Ishaan is shot dead in the climax! Dude, that was
pathetic, seriously! At least you could've given a chance for Govind to
confess himself to him, clear the tensions and make him give into his
love for Vidya. More friendship tears in the audience I believe, no?</p>
<p>Oh, and a smaller mistake but not counted that is, Australia is missing!
I don't know why UTV Motion Pictures, a big branded company didn't had
the budget to take the crew outside despite the effect it had showed in
the book. The line Vidya says, &quot;Some things that are priceless are
usually free.&quot; was needed to make the viewer get the effect. Okay, if
not Australia, why not make a small trip to Goa or even Porbander,
Gujju's Goa rather!</p>
<p>The newbies in the movie are good. Omi's red eyes were the highlight.
Ishaan's enthusiasm was the same as the book. Govind scolding Ishaan and
his accounting scenes are power-packed. Amrita Puri is a sweetheart
Vidya, not as much as the writer had confessed in his book but
nevertheless. Characters are tight so this doesn't make for further
evaluations. Abhishek Kapoor is over-rated, as the movie doesn't belong
to him at all. It's just plain direction under Bhagat's instructions. A
strange thing to observe was, the foul language was NOT screened out.
Guess, the Censor Board has begun to accept them as dialogues now. There
might be &quot;The Departed&quot;'s Hindi version soon if this continues.</p>
<p>Overall, the movie could've been better if it was more touchy with
friendship and acceptance but unfortunately, it isn't. Rather, it ends
as a simple one with too many edits from the book and no strong message
delivered.</p>
