</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Looking&nbsp;at&nbsp;his&nbsp;sagged, burgundy laden scooter, Mr.Subramaniam&nbsp;sets out
on his regular office routine. Dressed in a formal white-striped shirt
on&nbsp;a light-grey hazed bell-bottomed brazed trousers, he silently pulls
out the scooter of the parking lot to wake it up for the hectic
schedule. A shiny old helmet tops his attire with a lunchbox attached to
the scooter's handlebar to signify the long day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile as the day begins, Bangalore's roads get nastier. Vehicles
break signals, run over the footpaths and honk excessively to just be an
inch ahead of the rest. Slow moving ones are always cursed, two-wheelers
scolding four-wheelers for the narrow road space being occupied and the
policemen struggling hard to catch rule-breakers. Mr.Subramaniam is
aware of his daily experience&nbsp;with this three-decade old scooter which,
till date hasn't broken down even once in it's service.</p>
<p>The scooter was bought&nbsp;when Mr.Subramaniam was fed up of the harsh
realities of walking everyday to work or finding a bus, rare in those
days to catch when he began service&nbsp;in a government office as an
accountant. He had taken help from all his friends to realize his&nbsp;own
private vehicle. Priced hard during those days, it was a trending piece
in the market and was featured in all newspapers. Eventually, the pride
of owning&nbsp;turned into love for the thing.</p>
<p>Seeing his new generation in cars and fancy bikes, Mr.Subramaniam
is&nbsp;ignorant. His own children are now self-worthy to buy their own
vehicles and insist they upgrade his vehicle. But he is unperturbed with
his pride, aware of that longing bond that might break. In his last few
years of service left, he wants it to fulfill his dream - of travelling
together in toiling times.</p>
<p>Kick starting his pride, Mr.Subramaniam sits on the spring suspended
seat to begin his day. A puff of smoke clears the engine, ready to run.
Turning right, the scooter encounters various potholes, sand, people and
finally stops at a signal. On green, Mr.Subramaniam panics to find
fellow motorists shouting on him for being slow and &quot;blocking the way&quot;.
But he silently swallows them all and continues. A steep curve is ahead
to which Mr.Subramaniam sulks for his pride to put in extra work and
then lowers the gear. The scooter moves slower, this time, those
over-speeding bikes staring into the scooter and frowning for the
tortoise that ran&nbsp;beside.</p>
<p>With all the scuffles, he reaches office, sips tea, shouts on the peon
for giving more work. Working all day over and getting late for home,
then begins the journey back.&nbsp;This time, the story repeating in the
reverse direction.</p>
