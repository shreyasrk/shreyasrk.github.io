Sometimes, why the time has to tick forward? Why should not it tick
backwards ? So that I could re-live those days again ?!!

Guess, this again, makes me hum the song, "Give me some sunshine, Give
me some Rain; Give me another chance, I wanna grow up once again......."
from the movie, '3 idiots'. So hypothetical, but very true. This song
always pings me whenever I see my old Engineering photos in my computer.

Gosh, how quickly time flies ! It looks like just the other day, on the
first day of my Engineering Physics Lab, when I was doing some random
stuffs on the apparatus setup with another geek. God knows what it was,
but then it led me stand besides 2 chattering guys unknowingly.
Irritated on the first moment, I tried to stay away but then as time
advanced during the lab, became quite cool with that. But heck, I never
realized that those 2 guys were the starting bond of a terrific gang
that made waves in the department itself !!

This then advanced to sitting beside them the next day onwards, having
loads of chattering and talking nonsense (which looked quite sensible at
that time like canteen food , Kannada actresses, college chicks and a
few other silly stuff). This led to the growth of our gang by a few
more, I mean a couple of benches in the front and in the back. All types
of people, Short-tempered, maniacal, patient, dumb, intelligent and what
not. Slowly, we all bonded very well, the first step being going out for
a movie. I still remember the one called "Lakshya" of Farhan Akhtar for
which we all went after a tough semester exam. The joy, the pranks and
the fun we had was quite awesome. Then we all grew together, as if
staying in the same house; internals with a jolly mood, externals with
total seriousness and then goofing it up in the end; parties for each
and every occasion, be it for flunking in exams or a reason like coming
to college !

There was something unique, so peaceful and so much life in every moment
that you can try it even now. Just pass through a nearby college and you
shall get to know what I am conveying out here. See a couple or two ?
Now roll back to history and see for yourself. There is fun, seriousness
and a somewhat, "student" approach, totally absent of worldly
responsibilities, just like the smile of an innocent child and a
substance, somewhat divine and pure that you wont get anywhere else.

All this sounds normal now, but this was very much special for me. For
it was a complete opposite to what I was grown into ; in a meritorious,
competitive-edged and a dumb environment. All were total geeks, delved
into those 200 page text-books, having just eaten it up a thousand times
over and over. Nothing but study; no cricket, no time pass and no
outside eateries too ! Harsh thing was, I was kept aside by everyone
until I came face to face with a tragedy ! Sometimes, while going for
the counselling rounds, I used to curse god for giving me such bad luck,
but now he juxtaposed me to this totally whacky, out-of-this world
experience, which I would certainly cherish for a lifetime.

By the way, shall post about the department fun activities sometime
later. Chao !
