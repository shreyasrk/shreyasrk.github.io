Creative Writing can reach many heights. It is just to market it
yourselves. Recently, there was a cricket tournament organized in my
office and I volunteered to write the match review of the one that I
played. It was so much appreciated that I was then forced to take up
that job of writing match reports ! What an irony ! I wanted to check my
fluency in the writing language of English and now, people assign some
stupid job onto my head, even though I had a hell lot of office work to
do.

Thinking of re-reading the Banker book to get some tricks about "how to
escape things and live happier".
