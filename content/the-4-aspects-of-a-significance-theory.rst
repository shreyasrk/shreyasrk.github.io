Today, as I was just having a group study for my internal exams, I came
across an extremely important, yet unnoticed method of how to perceive
significance level in any field / topic.

When a topic is presented to man, the first thing he does is to try to
get its significance factor and then begins with the analysis where as
the reverse should hold true enough. This topic could be of any field,
subject to the man's interest. This theory is just a disciplined
approach of how to gain a prominent value of a topic which a person
analyses about. This topic could be anything, be it a research theme, a
concept or a simple formula.

| It basically follows a 4 step methodology which people usually ignore but is actually essential:

| 1. Basics: Get the foundation of the topic correct ! After all, you can appreciate only when you know the topic in detail!

2. Application: Once you know about the topic well, then human brain
starts thinking into applying process of using the topic in varied
aspects.

3. Research: Now that the topic is even well applied, can it be further
investigated about its hidden powers ? Man now gets into the
undiscovered areas.

4. Significance: Once the basics and the research are through only then
a particular significance of the topic comes into the picture. In
shorter terms, a broader view of the enormous capability of that topic.

An example would be a Einstein's theory of relativity.

Hope this helps for you readers !

Cheers.
