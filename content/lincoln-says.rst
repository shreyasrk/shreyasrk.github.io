.. that there are four steps to keep on moving, which are:

1. I am a slow walker, but I never walk backwards: The trick is to focus
not on how good you are, but on getting better. Good idea to ensure that
you are moving towards your goal at all times. You may make slow
progress -- but make sure you are making progress at all times.

2. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity: If you
sometimes feel that Lady Luck is not smiling at you, maybe it's because
you are not preparing hard enough. The opportunity is there -- but you
aren't quite ready to grab it. Don't let that happen. Slog, and your
time will come.

3. Whatever you are, be a good one: Perhaps what our Idiot,
Mr.Ranchoddas in the movie did.

4. I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was
yesterday : An extended line to show that we have to keep learning new
skills are become better than what we were.

| And lastly, to end the note, here is one.
| "Whose shoes do you polish?" : An art of remaining humble to the core with no signs of arrogance coming up. Forgetting the result and moving on is perhaps the easiest thing that we never do.

Cheers to Lincoln !
