Feels like blogging daily nowadays. Guess what, I have my own room to
boast off and the damn computer resides here itself !

All night downloads, Chat engines active all the time and some movie
watching have become too common in just 7 days. New discoveries? Well,
learnt to skim through the code a little bit smoothly, everything near
my new house is very far to get and moreover, mileage of the bike has
dropped !! Sounds vague but true.

Usually people think of some great achievements, but for me, even going
to office sounds like ohh-gaad!! not again.

Missing my old college days: no responsibility, no headaches and
moreover, no managers !!
