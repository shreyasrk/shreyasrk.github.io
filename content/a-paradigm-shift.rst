Recently, I happen to do some career moves which, I think are fairly
justified now. But what, really made me to write this post was from a
request of a close friend who wanted to analyze my moves correctly
before pitching some advice. Well, if that is the case, as I respect him
for what he is for, read on..

I belong to one of those people who are really serious about making a
career change and don't know where and how to proceed. There are tons of
options available in this world, all looks equally attractive,
emotionally and financially. But the fact is that, you have only one
life and thats the worst part, you cannot live all of it !

Take my case. I have my own dreams to be, let them be where they are at
present. But why does God gives only one single life to live ? Or only a
certain limited number of years in that, and not forever? I guess,
Nature has its own law to follow but, we are pretty small creatures who
cannot compete. But anyways, this looks like I have Time-management
problem and unnecessarily putting blames on others which is also a
common problem found.

Ahh.. where am I heading to ! Lets come back. Remember my older post of
2 guys standing outside a private bank to obtain some kind of forms ?
Many guessed it on-the-spot ! Well, that was me and my friend only. Life
was sucking out and then, no growth seen even in the farther areas,
tried to attempt this shot. But, when I saw the maddening rush, was
shocked and convinced together as most of the youngsters are facing the
same problem. Everybody wants everything quick. Be it quick money, quick
admissions, quick jobs, quick loans and quick needs. Hope this would not
result in quick children in future ! But on a December night, I fell in
love with a movie character.

This movie character was just similar to my friend whom i was discussing
in my previous posts. Full of passion towards his studied field and had
no demands from it. Contributing heavily in that and living life like he
wanted. Carving out his own paths when others just walk on roads carved,
swims against the tide when others are with the water. Consoling himself
to be motivated all the time by tricking out himself. And helping out
friends ! I learnt something from that character. Live your passion !!

But the fact remains, I don't have not just one passion ! And moreover,
my motivation factor zooms up to a level, then back to zero ! Need some
tips from fellow bloggers to stay atop all the time without even turning
my eyes off the track.
