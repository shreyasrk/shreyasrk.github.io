About me: Shreyas Kulkarni.

In the verge of upgrading myself. With words, lines and thoughts. Had
shifted to Singapore for a while. And am now back to India. Please bear
with the boredom here, I'm not being humble.

Occupation: Streamlining and expanding knowledge at the same time.
Was in a `startup <http://www.magnetworks.in>`__. Now back to mainstream
software development.

Interests: Anything that the brain admits of having an impact.

Movies: So far, I've enjoyed the ones that have either flopped or have
become the cult classics.

Music: I turn on the player for weeks and not for months sometimes. Any
variations are permitted.

Books: Off late, I've started to pick up a collection. Visit
`Goodreads <http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8979970-shreyas>`__ for
my shelf. Don't judge for the choices - they aren't mine altogether.

Find me on `GitHub <https://github.com/shreyasrk>`__ and
`Twitter <https://twitter.com/curlyreggie>`__ too!
