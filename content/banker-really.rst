Some days back, I read the book, `If God was a
Banker <http://www.mouthshut.com/product-reviews/If_God_was_a_Banker_-_Ravi_Subramanian-925075990.html>`__
by Ravi Subramaniam and was quite amused. Why ? Well, the reason is
simple. The fact explained in his book is quite evident anywhere,
everywhere. You cannot limit the tactics played around by people only to
the industry he refers to but to the entire sector where in a person
does a job to survive for himself. When it comes to people, in a hunger
only to grow, come whatever may, who can stoop down to any level, be it
selling even your parents for the heck of it. Such numbers are growing
quite enormously in a large organization, specially in MNCs. Inability
to handle such organizations by some heads, the lower ranks then try to
get into the fight of "growth" by just taking some silly credits for
which others toil their days and nights out; projection of things they
hardly know or be in the verge of just pulling others legs for their
games.

Amidst all such idiots few stand out as the genuine, who are honest;
work really hard; have a disciplined mindset; value driven and of
course, spirited more than the cunning ones. I dont know what makes them
stick around with such people all the time. Dont they get thoughts of
quitting such companies ? I dont know. But there must be something that
drives them to work and excel in their streams.

One thing is sure, such ones flock around as companies need them. Others
stay in the same old organization as they dont know their USP itself.

Read it, for you to realize the realities of the real corporate world !
