When I see my first post of that precious letter (offer letter one !), I
feel jittery about it. The reason is simple enough, I haven't done much
in the line of work in these 2 years ! I joined to serve, to become a
good professional in terms of work that I do, work that should have been
more interesting and fun. The tasks now I do is to check out mails, get
nagged by a few users on the phone and then , wind up for the day, go
home and watch TV and blog like this. God !! These could have been done
at home itself. But the point is, you don't get paid a decent amount for
it. ;) They say about recession and stuff like that, but this bore thing
can really take you to heights.

You start giving up on yourself. The dreams that you set for yourself,
starts to die from within. You don't feel like pushing for yourself or
for anything else in life, for that, the energy is fading away. The
spirit of work is no longer existing. The support never existed from
peers or higher management. It has turned drastically from enthusiasm to
a mere duty and then ending up in a cruel compromise. When you are
bogged down by people who are just finding a chance to pull your leg,
this thing gets even more disastrous. I hear complaints from people that
I am getting impatient and so on. Well, the reason is pretty much laid
out above ! Many friends that I know, are turning to America again for
anything better than this kind. I see people earning more than double
the amount , but the question still lies underneath ... Are they really
happy in this field or is it a compromise which is not showing out ?
