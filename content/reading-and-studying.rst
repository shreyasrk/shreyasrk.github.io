Well, into the 100th post, I wanted to scribble something beneficial,
something of value which I can reckon later after I skim through it all
over or rather, read through it.

People study. People read. But often appears the question of the
difference between the two. How do people read so much in their lives
and study so less? What makes studying and reading the same book so
different? How impacting is reading a book than studying it?

Then, I found the answer via a bit of observance. Studying requires far
more entities than your eyes and your mind - it needs time. It needs an
immense amount of patience to not skim the words just because you didn't
understand. It requires a fine taste of detail to pick out selectivity
out of what you tend to remember and apply. It also underlies a fair
amount of hidden agenda of what your facts might just render so that you
might dig in more. It requires a fair deal of your mental emotion of
expression. And of course, it can just make you wiser, intelligent and
learned.

Reading on the other hand, isn't all of them - although the thinking
part will still linger through the whole book. It is about an essence -
an essence of the writer's mind. A feeling, so thoroughly explained so
as to not worry about it later on. It cannot teach you how you want to
think or might to, butÂ to ponder over what's going on. A book,
thoroughly read isn't necessary that you applied. It means to remember
certain aspects that touched your heart once. And sometimes, skimming or
not understanding is permitted!

Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a fine writer who is helping me to find these
subtle differences. I sometimes, have to forcefully read slowly just to
get the words understood which is getting into the study mode by a
frisk.

To cut it short, Reading and Studying are just like Hearing and
Listening. You tend to give attention to the latter far more than the
former.
