Drooling over lazy weekends, unable to find an idea for a weekend
project, I happen to crash into `this <http://medium.com/tech-talk>`__
on Twitter. Some crazy, yet sensible advises gushed in, making this
inactive mind think and agree. One such significant portion was `this
article <https://medium.com/tech-talk/d5f8051afce2>`__. Read it. No,
seriously. It changes the way you think about the things that have come
into this world from the digital mind.

Developing code isn't an easy job. And optimizing it isn't easier. Let
us first write some lines of code, no matter how complex we think. It
then boils down to editing, reviewing and rewriting code. Only then, the
so-called, "Design Patterns", "Principles", "Scalability" and other
nonsensical tech terms pop in. You cannot just think about writing an
interface in the first instant!

All you need is some idea to begin with and a language to start
communicating with the computer. Be it any language of your choice. You
might be wondering whether it'd help in switching for a better career in
the market. Truth is, the job market out there is weird and extremely
complex. Everyday, the job requirements change, urging you to learn them
just to "stay in the herd". Fact is, it doesn't matter. Nowadays, people
look at how you think rather than what you used. This principle is what
I've noticed in startups, to an extent.

I thus stuck to Java. It might irritate the Python lovers but let us
keep the language wars aside. Learn a language properly and then think
about switching, if it isn't serving the project's purpose. And yes, let
us keep those rules aside and write some code. Please. And interviewers,
stop asking the basic Singleton pattern or Factory pattern in your
interviews. Most of the code these days don't work in that line!
