People can really get annoying. Taking you for granted. You can't
decipher the mindset unless you get a tight hard slap with their mouths.

Take the case of one pal. This guy is a tech freak and had inspired many
to follow his list of activities. A sound applied mind with an urge to
learn new technologies in the computing world, he was a sure shot of
inspiration. Coming from a town having dreams of none other than
becoming the next Steve Jobs, he motivated the ignorant to really look
into the world in an inquisitive manner. But things turned sour one day.

It was the way he used to take in others' concerns. The way it was
ditched was heinous, let alone admire the thing of the idea. He would
imagine that idea into reality in a flash moment, a feat rarely seen.
But the point of letting it go in a very harsh manner was not his right.
Either he would dump the idea saying it as baseless or would consider
very amateurish. Being brilliant with coding and algorithmic thinking
but equally introverted and an attitude: harsh, demeaning and straight
forward. That hurts when the advice pour in a language not supposed to
be in for others.

What happened was he had shared an idea. Maybe, he just wanted to market
it or show it off. But the idea was confined to a college level and the
general public wouldn't be interested. Obviously, friends would think of
suggesting a place to market it better, to make it more visible and
popular. The manner in which the reply came was bitter. Disturbing.
Hard. A reply depicting wrong attitude. That effects the mind, specially
if the recipient is not adjusted to such! You then think inside of what
wrong did you say and become more careful in picking up contacts.

Bah! People.
