Over the impact of friends and peers, I happen to dig out some gems in
the celluloid history. Certain people, whose work surpasses the common
norm of ignorance. Hence, making them into a list of them wouldn't be
much of a harm, wouldn't it? And admiring the work of these persons in
every, single project of theirs is worth an experience in itself.

-  Stanley Kubrick
-  Martin Scorsese
-  Guy Ritchie
-  Christopher Nolan
-  Steven Spielberg
-  Kevin Spacey
-  Clint Eastwood

And yes, this list would grow, if not here, in other posts. Till then,
will be searching in IMDB for more such diamonds.
