Yesterday, I happened to scan some
`movies <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film>`__ of the bygone era. An era
still prevalent but seemed historical. As I was examining them, a piece
caught my attention. The piece was from none other but the very own king
of mass entertainment,
`Rajinikanth <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinikanth>`__. The god of
masses, who mesmerized audience with his sheer cut-through style
statements -- a quality which the
`Bollywood <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood>`__ envies,
`Tollywood <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Andhra_Pradesh>`__
embraces and the people worship, is one super king of dialogues that
enthralled the south-east `Asia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia>`__
for decades. But the post is not about our "Thalaivar"'s stardom, it is
about a lady who made a sheer comeback with her acting skills.

The character enacted signifies about an ego-maniacal lady with an
unending passion for her love who, falls for his style and beauty that
converts into an unlawful revenge. A revenge, taken after a patient
ambush of 18 years when circumstances play a havoc on both of their
lives. Credit must be given to the actress for portraying such a
venomous role with perfection that the viewer fills his heart with
hatred, post-screening. The presence surpasses our style king for some
time, adding that, the plot moves in her way making her role gain more
weight. The actress captures your mind, not from the start but on a
stage when the protagonist's father passes away and her crave for the
hero turns into a devilish retaliation. From then on, you watch the
movie for the next move of the narrative and nothing else until the
climax.

Many well-known critics have praised about the hero's "vintage stuff"
state that this movie brought with, but it tends to be a skewed opinion.
Credit must be given to the woman, who is the real central figure for,
it hinted not only that a woman can equal a man, she can even surpass
him in the process. A movie and a role so inspiring that it had to be
penned down, not just on a `micro
blog <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging>`__ but on the bigger
version of it.
