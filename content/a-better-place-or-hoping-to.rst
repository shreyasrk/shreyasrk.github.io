Ahh.. after a month long trekking deputation to Coimbatore, I landed in
Bommanahalli office for a new life. Was this the right decision ?

God knows ! Because, this looks the total opposite of what I was
currently at my old office. People are damn serious about their work,
sometimes have seen people doing night-outs (unknown at Koramangala) and
enjoying the process too !

I feel, sometimes life gives you chances only to take them away later.
But hope is what makes our zeal stronger.

Shall post about Coimbatore experiences some other time..
