Sameer is into love with any girl he sees, Siddharth Sinha is busy with
2 professions, as a painter and a coolie and Akash is planning around
some trips, party and Shalini. All three plan up for Goa and then have a
blast ! Come back, they have a petty fight and life splits up for all
3.. Sameer finds his true love, Akash finally falls into it and Sid
loses it.. But, in the end, they all stick together, leaving all of it
behind and stay as the best of friends for ever..

Sounds familiar to you ? Yes.. its the same "Dil Chahta Hai" movie that
I was remembering about and saw it yesterday, again after a gap of 3-4
years ! The cinematography, sounds, music, designs and artistic talents
all revved it up as a fresh and younger generation movie altogether.
This movie sounds fresh even to this date, guess no other movie can even
match the level of freshness described in here.. Guess, this might have
caused some jitters for other directors as they thought they had made a
revolution in Hindi cinema. Farhan Akhtar's directorial ones, I mean all
of them, have somewhat different from other boring, crappy ones.

Ohh.. the main point.. Friends ! No one can ever imagine a life without
them. You learn, you fight, you hate but you are finally back to talking
and having fun ! Love can wait, but friends wont. ;)
