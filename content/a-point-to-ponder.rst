As I was sipping through the evening tea amid a sunny clad weather, I
noticed something. The vapours of the tea were swirling over the cup.
These vapours had a flurry of dance provoked by an external agent. With
the wind being that, these were fluttering along the direction in which
it passed through. At some point of time, they swooned to the right and
then after a pause, to the left. Maybe was it following the tune or was
it signalling a message in them?

The message strikes when we juxtapose with our very own lives. Struggle,
confusions and the choices that we make along as life passes. An
external agent usually provokes us in one way or the other and so, our
life goes into that direction. The agent? Circumstances! They in our
case can make us lead to a path known or to a roadblock, only to take
diversions. Choices can't be made in all situations, just like the
vapours in my tea who don't know in which direction the wind carries
them away. In the end, all the vapours lead into the same cloud and then
the rain pours in.

What's mysterious is how we are tuned by these circumstances and then
realize as we reach a certain stage in ourselves. Some are lucky to be
carried in the right path, some are backtracked in an opposite way and
some keep going around themselves, unaware of the fact that is
controlling them. In the end, we all become individuals, the cloud. And
then pours in happiness and hope, the rain. Of course, rain can also
bring disasters for the circumstances in totality, cause the vapours.

I do feel that there should be a point where in we need to stop, analyze
ourselves and seek for a path. But, just being carried away by the
things that control us doesn't make us do that. A point to ponder?
