Well, things are turning up a little hotter for me nowadays.

1. Got some good advice from
`friend <http://www.blogger.com/profile/13560131434782292141>`__ about
the way life goes and have become a little bit relaxed and patient.

2. Found some good thing to
`read <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns>`__. A
recommended One.

3. Becoming more technically oriented; found a good site to
`research <http://www.brighthub.com>`__. That MBA stuff is like kicking
your own bum from the past experience.

4. Finally became Bangalore-d after a long wait of 20+ years !

Some things are brightening up for sure. Cheers to life !
