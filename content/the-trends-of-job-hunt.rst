Nowadays, programmers are getting better. Or rather, we're finding
better programmers. Better in quality, quantity and adaptability. You
can see a constant trend of change in the `programming
software <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_tool>`__ and the same
reflects rather very quickly into these brains too. A constant fear
therefore, appears in the minds of people who don't catch up to the
fast-paced world.

And of course, there are a zillion start-ups appearing every now and
then in the day. Every person is a start-up, putting his ideas to of
some use. Lets keep money factor aside as this piece is more of a
technical one. So, a small pattern detected in the recent company list
crawls up. Here goes..

1. `Data Mining <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining>`__: Data.
Data. Data. The world's databases are filled with over a peta-byte of
information. Storage devices have shrunk in size, processors are tinier
but more powerful making data more portable to carry over. I myself have
surprisingly, started working only with `virtual
machines <http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/>`__ stored on an `external
hard drive <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive>`__! The entire
system being hosted on that little piece makes it easier to store more
data. And that crude data is now being thought of as a gold mine in the
recently watched presentations. A thing which needs to be searched for
hidden information. And there pops in Data Mining. If you're good in
Python/R and a bit of analytical modelling, you're set. All that matters
is how you mine data and you have plenty of mining algorithms via
`Machine Learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`__ and
`Artificial
Intelligence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence>`__.
Sample courses on `Coursera <http://https://www.coursera.org/>`__
shouldn't be that difficult.

2. Product `Scaling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability>`__:
You've a product er.. piece of software and you want it to be seen on
every lame person on earth. The product might not be that robust to
handle the traffic once it goes viral and hence, app scaling comes into
picture. Most of the applications are web-based, so you always have
centralized servers to provide the back-end support the app needs. Most
of the initial product stages are on a single server which is simple
enough to perform a request of up to 500 users but then the problems
kick in once the user base exceeds this limit. You need to scale and
quick! Many web servers have `performance
tuning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_tuning>`__ tools that
can scale this to an extent unimaginable. Oh yes, you also have
clustering mechanisms that can be made to split up the traffic handling.
Gearing up on web server deployment and core infrastructure performance
mechanisms is one more field to look. And this comes plainly from
experience sometimes.

3. Coding: Programming software is evolving at an exponential rate. You
coded in C++ a year before and in 6 months, the world moved to Java and
within 2 days, moved to Python. Why? Lazier to code many lines, language
support on the web, API integrations and many more. That drills down to
some core computing principles of Design Patterns, Algorithms and
technical fundamentals. The concepts might not change, but that
`IDE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`__
you use and the language you talk to in that IDE do. Pick up these on
either ProjectEuler or TopCoder. Don't care about what the world thinks
about these sites. I'm getting benefited by them in a scale, unthinkable
of myself.

Many more might be on that list. Enough for now. Until next post.
