Although the busyness of life snatches the essence of it completely, one
can always try to stop in between and enjoy the journey so far. We have
forgotten the essential completeness that we later start to miss them.
Making time for friends, eating a delicious meal together for a long,
long time, savoring the joys that went pass, pulling each other's legs
and remembering those memories over a cup of tea can be such a blessing
in disguise.

Knowing what happens in your professional line of work every single
minute over the things that might increase your productivity by a
marginal rate is by so far, the biggest time-waster. Cutting down on
social networking web-sites and increasing more of actual social life
would be more fulfilling. Having to bother about what next side-project
to work on or to fix that code happening in my current project and not
doing anything about it but procrastinate, is more devastating than
spending that same time, surfing the net for boredom. Watching the same
old movies on television rather than experiencing different experiences
via a billion new others, a zillion books to read and learning via
educational videos and documentaries would bring in more happiness.
Don't you think?

Lazying around can be fruitful too. It helps to NOT think. Not to worry
about various headaches going on. A chat with best of pals, not about
anything to do with the usual world but of fascinating talks on
knowledge, wisdom and experiences are a boon. A look into those old
albums where you had the best days can soothe the mind.

Of course, work is important too. Only until it serves the purpose of
providing you a means of survival. It can never be your life.
