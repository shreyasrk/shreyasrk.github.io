How often do you wind off your routine to crash into that couch and play
some games to cool yourself? I check out Stick Tennis quite often and
went to a level quite unbelievable in work.

| It isn't about the game as such but is rather, much more than that. It teaches you how to work and excel. Some that I found are:
|  1. Focus, focus and pure focus.
|  2. Don't be aware of your ongoing progress at that instinct when you've to deliver. Just give your best shot. Don't care about anything else.
|  3. Know your rules perfectly. A game improperly known is a game improperly played.
|  4. Know your opponent carefully. Study his movements and his working patterns.
|  5. Always be aware of surprises.
|  6. Don't take anything to heart. You always have an extra set to prove your meddle if you lose the first one.
|  7. It is okay to lose, too! You cannot be a winner all the time.
|  8. Compete against the best. Always. And yes, compete.
|  9. A calm mind will give the best of results. Don't panic in any situation.
|  10. Be aware of your over-confidence going above the zero limit during the game. That snatches your winning chances. If you cannot control, breath hard and shout "Shut up" to yourself. That helps.
|  11. Fine-tune your strengths. Weaknesses take time.
|  12. Keep a very low margin of error. But keep extending your limits on boundaries.
|  13. Make sure your game is sportive rather than personal vengeance.

Play the game and excel in "World Domination". That's one game to not
miss out. The difficulty level rises sharply after every level, and so
your game changes too.
