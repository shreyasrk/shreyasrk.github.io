With a headache tinkering, uneasiness swiveling and the mind numbed,
Keerthan set out for the day. Loads of work awaited - his head treatment
was overdue for 2 weeks for he had to tonsure his head to begin with,
college work was pending with no proper coordination from the office
personnel and his own personal list of activities growing up
exponentially.

Keerthan had just one thing in mind. To finish up his tasks for the day
for a peaceful, extended weekend. He drew cash from the nearby ATM to
recharge for his overdue mobile balance. But the ache and the task list
bombarded at the same time. Unaware of the task in hand, he boarded the
city bus to reach his college, only to realize for the purpose of
drawing cash later! Ignoring the stupidity, he continued.

Keerthan was a bit smarter this time, getting down at stops of proximity
for there was lunch time approaching for the office people. He hurried
into the office with a pre-planned mind to yell at the staff for their
irregularities and irresponsibilities. But it turned quite the opposite,
he being polite in his queries and a reply sounding professional.
Convinced with their reply, he then went to the Computer Centre, took a
PC and began his list work.

Whenever you work online, you are bound to have a chat and the same
happened to Keerthan with his friends. And then came the pleasant
change!

The girl was a tall, brunette coloured, well-figured beauty who wore a
sleeveless flowery top with black shorts having glasses that looked like
she had borrowed them from her granny- big and oval-shaped which anybody
else would have just ignored her for the design of it. But not Keerthan.
He sat there dumbstruck looking into her face, deeply and
affectionately, unaware of the lone drawback that she encompassed. She
was conversing with her friend about the climate change because the
weather grew suddenly hot and the conditioning was not enough. The light
conversation was a music to our Keerthan when she was laughing in
between. He could feel the care in that, her voice being soft and low as
a feather. But, all of a sudden, his friend pinged him up to come over
for lunch and there crushed his dream.

When he left the room, he gave quite a stare - of a silent one, glancing
stealthily and wanted to ask her for a date. But she was busy ignoring
him as her conversation raised her voice giving a sign. And when the
door closed behind him, there came the look from the girl of searching
him outright and feeling the disappointment!

Poor Keerthan. He should have turned around.
