Recently, I happened to have this strange habit of picking up those
hi-funda, hyped books in recent times thinking about whether, it really
has that power of being so famous. Sadly that disappointed me which was
way below expectations. The book I was referring to was the one which
recently won The Man Booker Prize, "The White Tiger" by Aravind Adiga.

This book describes about a village chap, Munna who comes to city hoping
of some greener pastures and ends up killing his own master ! In order
to describe the line just said, the author took 320 pages ( roughly)
including humiliating in the very own country that he lives in. An eye
opener, only for those who can take it in the right sense, but what
about the average reader ? He will think that here is a man who is
getting awarded by demoralizing the country and its fellowmen ! Strange
panel, but the point here is that this book makes our country stand
naked in front of the whole world about the bad things that go about
inside. Of course, the situation will improve, but this doesnt mean that
you start glamorizing it to the mankind ! No country is perfect, but
others are always looking at what the other is doing or is flawed about
and lowers the image.

Overall, it explains the real happenings of a person, which gets
generalized in the end, making you think that, is this our India ?
