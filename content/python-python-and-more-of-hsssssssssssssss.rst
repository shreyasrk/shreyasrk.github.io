So, I joined a new company dealing in the same technology but a
different domain. While lazying out the entire day doing nothing (I'm on
initial roll, so no major work yet), I happened to browse through some
Python docs and found some amazing resources which, hopefully, should
have bumped into way before I began coding in Python/Django.

Here goes the list:

1. Beginner - https://docs.python.org/2/ : The fundamental, basic and
yet most important resource to go through Python. Start
`here <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`__ for a
beginner's intuitive lesson to know about Python.

2. Beginner (moving on after knowing what is what)
- http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/ : By far, the best ever
site to learn Python. You can learn only via practice and this site
ensures that you are exposed to it, tons of it. The problem sets are
awesome and you get hooked pretty fast into liking the language. Delve
into this to know `how a web framework can be easily written in
Python. <http://anandology.com/blog/how-to-write-a-web-framework-in-python/>`__
That blew my mind for an instant. If you need some solutions to the
problems in the tutorial, refer the
`courses <http://anandology.com/blog/notes-from-advaced-python-workshop/>`__.

3. Intermediate (and er, advanced)
- http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/ : Wonderful, wonderful site.
It tells you everything about how to design code in Python all the way
into learning advanced concepts.

Ohh, and tried to learn something even more awesome from `Linux Kernel
Coding
styles <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/CodingStyle>`__ and
`How to be a better
manager <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/ManagementStyle>`__.
Non-pythonic, but is effective in a long way for a developer.
