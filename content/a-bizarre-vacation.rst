Post is written in a busy Computer Centre in my university. Dont know
how many cursings I might get to waste time here, but anyways as they
say.... Whoever, whatever they say !

Here goes. The most amazing break I can ever get. Man, life should be
slowed down a little to live as said by some senior advicer-cum-blogger
around. I dont know it pays or not but surely helps yourself. No arbits
anymore here.

Things were quite fast in a civilized world around: 4 subjects, 4
months, 15 assignments, 3 projects, 4 exams, confused syllabus, low
esteem, no friends, no party, no nothings, no movies, recycled music, no
iPod, no braggings, no likes, terribly maintained Facebook, clothes and
health, 1 sem. My, My ! This would surely freak me out if I extended.
Wanted to just run away from the bizarre virtual competition around and
blessed with 3 full months of rocking time pass.

On a usual verge similar to others to utilize my time, which never
happened though, I had applied for a summer internship in one of the
leading organizations. Converted it, for no money in return of course,
but never imagined it to be that tough on me. To read Books ! Well,
somehow pushed the limits of going through and went back to start up a
project and the lead-in-charge, ordered me to get ideas ! Stupid as it
sounds, if you view from a topper's perspective as an excuse to run away
building your resume, but I just walked out. On a serious note, it was
the best thing I had done or was doing.

Why ? Because of the fun filled 2 months thereafter ! Whoa ! What a
vacation it was. First a trip to the land of History. Next to the Windy
plateus of my home state for a friend's marriage in a friend's car,
recently bought at that time. Finally came the Green route Trek that was
a roller coaster. Got some verbal threatenings from close ones as my
freaking out was above their limits.

All the fire doused off then. I was just at home, savoring the rich
food, meeting old friends and marriage ceremonies to attend, my list
became full ! And when the call came to go back, I was nervous. For the
first time !! Finally settled with all the dues, I hurriedly slopped
into a pre-planned house to settle down. And now, the mad rush begins
again.

Damn, time doesnt stop..
