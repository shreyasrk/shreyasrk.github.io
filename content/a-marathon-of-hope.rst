I thought of deviating from my personal boring posts but the sole
motivation to turn up for a blog was the same and thus, I take back my
words. Let us jump to a new topic, hope.

Hope is a bitch. A true bitch. For it gives us an emotion to hold on to
the things we do and a faith invisible in behavior. It gives us the
motivation to hang in there and the zeal to persevere. The ability to
accept hardships and willingness to meet boredom. But, hope cannot make
us achieve results. It can only give us a hand on the shoulder to keep
trying and surge ahead.

After the grueling 2011, with a new environment and a new study regime
picked up amidst the brainy of the lot and the slogging junta, I braced
myself for 2012. The year of anticipation of a new hope and a new life
amid a new place. Again.

And it gave me exactly the way I had expected - the worst of problems,
the best of moments, new habits, wonderful people and a beautiful life.
I won't exaggerate on the problems here but there are lessons to be
learned which I could share.

"Always account for variable change." A mantra for your ongoing
expeditions. Some have the ability to plan and execute and some move as
per the tide flow. My experience - have a mix of both. You're subject to
a thing called "experience" which is nothing but your own mistakes amid
your planning and the changing circumstances.

"Focus on the thing in hand." They just say this. I'll complete the
remaining, "And don't care about anything else." Bring that stupid mind
in line, no matter what. Whether you hate it or disgrace the notion. You
have to focus and let go of everything else.

"Decide." Yes, the most common mistake that we falter on. You have to
decide on what you pick, whom you choose and where you want to go. And
never look back. You will realize it's beauty. Maybe not in quick
succession, but in sometime for sure.

"Motivation is bullshit." True to it's word. You don't need to be
motivated. Simple as that! You know what you're doing and that should be
enough for you to get you out of the bed at 4 in the morning or make you
slog for 20 hours a day rigorously for any time you have in hand.
Motivation is for nobody. It is good to hear such lines but tough to
follow them.

"Be patient." The word has an immense weight under it. Patience is not
something that you get out of the blue. It develops. Through peers,
activities, experiences and drawbacks.

"Believe in luck." You have to! When you give in your full strength and
are not able to make it, then leave it to work on it's own. You can see
the outcomes of it gradually.

"Learn." Yes, a simple thing to say but has far reaching effects. Learn
to code. Learn to fail. Learn to embrace. Learn to hug. Learn to talk.
Learn to eat. Learn to connect. Learn to quit. Learn to experiment.
Learn to do it yourself.

"Be selective." There shall be people and things that you're not
comfortable with. Ditch them. Period! It's okay to have some enemies
than cribbing behind. After all, we're human.

"Propagate gratitude." Most of us fail to do this. Tell yourself how
lucky you are. Tell your employer how lucky you are. Help some people
with the corrections you made. Tell your other half how much you care
for. There is never a beautiful thing than being grateful to someone.
You cannot do it all alone, for Christ's sake!

And all of the above, come from one single factor, hope. With a dream
and the faith that you could turn your imagination into reality.

Okay, enough of the lecture. I stop here. As these are some of the
things I came to know in some layers. It started with hope but ended up
as an advice.

Bah! I could be a professor someday!
