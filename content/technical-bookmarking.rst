Wow! Two blog posts in one day? Heights of joblessness, you see. Well,
this is for the forgetful nature of me not to add some directions to
what I should look for myself. Hope it's good for you too!

Basically, this is about sources I find interesting to learn on the net.
Here are some:

To get started at some useful links, here are some pointers:

1. \ `DZone <http://dzone.com>`__: A kickass website for all your
technical wrong-er-right doings and tips to learn how cool your code can
be.

2. `Java Code Geeks <http://www.javacodegeeks.com>`__: Strictly for Java
lovers. A complete website of links, tutorials, blogs and a wholesome
new experience of how awesome Java can work. Be it in Android, making
that first `java
Swing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29>`__
`UI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface>`__ or the enterprise
Java framework you're looking for, this site has all of it. Note:
Strictly for Java lovers, again! Oh,
`IBM <http://www.google.com/finance?q=LON:IBM>`__ ain't far behind,
check `this <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/>`__.

3. `Coursera <http://www.coursera.org>`__: A big salute to the founders
of this amazing place. Truly a gem of a link. The future of learning is
taking a big leap by virtualizing what you learn. Came to know that
`Georgia
Tech <http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=33.7758333333,-84.3947222222&spn=0.01,0.01&q=33.7758333333,-84.3947222222%20(Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology)&t=h>`__
is now offering a full online degree in Computer Science for a cost of a
fraction of the real thing. There's
`Udacity <http://www.udacity.com/>`__ too. But this link is just sheer
treasure.

4. `HTML/CS <http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/>`__\ S: `Web
Designing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design>`__. A new interest.
Attended a free class and just hooked onto it. Can use it
for \ `Mobile Web <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web>`__ too!
Check `this <http://hackdesign.org/courses/>`__,
`this <http://summerofdesign.com/>`__\ and
`this <http://school.nushackers.org/materials/html5_2012>`__ also.

5. Math: Ah, the love for it never ends. I know almost nothing in it but
the fact that this subject changing lives is just phenomenal. Check for
blogs `here <http://aperiodical.com/>`__,
`here <http://richardelwes.co.uk/blog/>`__\ and
`here <http://www.mathblogging.org/posts>`__.

6. Reading: Oh yes, Internet reading is way lot cooler than it used to
be. One such website I found out was
`this <http://projectwordsworth.com>`__. The kind of language, the
simplicity of contexts and the intrigue is superb. If your book
collections dry up, its a good source to continue. And then we have
other posts on Twitter. Pick them up from your following crowd. I'm sure
they will post to make the world that they read. Last but the greatest
of all crashes, `this <http://medium.com>`__. A mind blowing website for
some sensible blogging.
