I've been blogging aggressively. Randomly. Haphazardly.
Non-meticulously. Shadily. With bits of skepticism. Made some posts
private (for reasons to stay private) and kept my writing skills at bay
by going simple.

Meanwhile, as "Beyoncé - Crazy in Love" loops in the back (I don't like
it but is still ongoing since 12 years. Just cannot stop some people.)
and Twitter being open on the monitor with lists going bizarre of
updates every second that I loose track of, I crash into this
`post <http://yourstory.com/2013/11/ys-lounge-bhak-sala/>`__. The
introduction and interview looks filmy, but I got carried away (like I
always do) from it's climax. The points mentioned were to be stored
somewhere and if it wasn't in Twitter (as it gets trolled from some
douche-bags often), then it had to be here. So, here goes what I have to
remember. Nothing for you to learn. You probably know them all and would
laugh on me for ignorance.

#. Be informed and well-read before putting in your opinions. The best
   opinions are the ones which are well structured as they're well
   informed and detailed to reason. 
#. Be good in basics and then innovate. No explanations needed.
#. Leadership comes from what step you first take.
#. Stop being cool about last-minute panic. It isn't cool if you want to
   know how the stuff works.

I'm turning out to be exposed into such matters every day. People judge
you. And your character. Which draws in respect. And drives it away too.
Taking away other things with it.

I suck at being too meticulous. But it is something I cannot be done
away from.
