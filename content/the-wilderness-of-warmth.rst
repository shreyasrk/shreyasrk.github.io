A touch of serenity. A strike of feel. To the ubiquitous self, a thought
arises - considering the options around and the stacks of talent in
hand. A generous piece of advice. The care of warmth.

For the broken thoughts, a fulfillment remains. Strangely, that
converges to personal worries. The face is unaware of it's power. The
mind is unaware of it's notoriety. The body listens and is hushed down.
Worry takes over the sanity. Control begins to depart. Temperament is
blown to pieces. Ongoing traffic is now a culprit. The wonderfully
cooked food is disgusted. Tension snakes into life. Again.

The thinking sleeps the cheerfulness. Hobbies cry for yearning. People's
expectations drop. And the peace of mind fades. Until that touch of
warmth lays beside. In the form of care. In the form of concern. In the
form of help. In the form of support.

In the form of love.
