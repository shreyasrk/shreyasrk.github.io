It's 7.30 AM in the life of an usual software programmer. He wakes up
lazily to the alarm beep, cribs about the day that began, posts "Good
Morning" messages to his `WhatsApp <http://whatsapp.com>`__ friends and
freshens up. An extra urgency has come up, the meeting scheduled in the
post-lunch afternoon is now preponed to post-breakfast. He cribs again,
irons his best formal shirt and trousers, puts them on and leaves.

Traffic in the city is horrendous. He's now slightly annoyed. Local
trains and buses are jam-packed to an extent of skipping 3-4 of them.
The journey ain't simple, he has to take transfers at interchanges and
rerun the mad rush all over, twice. Every day. Every single journey. He
ignores the ongoing mayhem and reaches to the venue.

Puts his bag of a pile of books, headphones, his tablet and wallet
aside, switches on the computer in front of him. The computer is running
Ubuntu, with his cronjobs going on in respective terminal consoles, sees
the change in data in the database and switches to his
`IDE <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>`__.
The meeting required a simple presentation of the ongoing status in the
project that he's assigned. Turns on Firefox, logs into Facebook,
scrolls down till that last known point of recurrence, closes the window
and begins to ponder what to do for the meeting.

Time is running out. He has to get something to show up. Being smart, he
turns to `reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/>`__ and starts
writing some code with screenshot attachments, some `HTML
code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML>`__ and
beautifies it with the CSS script. Edits and re-edits. Checks if
everything is in place and then that time comes.

He takes nothing with him to the meeting room. He knows the address
where his computer has been assigned. The manager asks for the slides.
He takes his laptop, types in that web address and voila! His
presentation is on the big screen. Impressed by the new technology,
manager pats on his back and winds things up.

Post meeting, he navigates to his favorite forums viz.,
`CodeProject <http://www.codeproject.com/>`__, `Hacker
News <http://hckrnews.com>`__ and Twitter feeds to "stay updated". Some
of the articles are extremely intriguing and further explorations happen
via Google. After knowing how that system works, he realizes it's lunch
time. Goes out to eat in that food outlet, picks up the traditional ones
and stuffs them up. Gets back to his seat with his favorite Coke.

Studies the requirement document and designs the desired outcome on a
sheet of paper. Finds that it deviates a bit, redesigns. Just then, his
mobile rings and calls of blabbering surge. WhatsApp messages blow up.
Cribs, cribs and cribs for how the things are going by. Nothing has been
coded yet. Evening dwells upon him and he's now under pressure, for the
requirement has to be checked into `Git
repository <http://git-scm.com>`__ by that night with the change-request
handling.

Night's back. Grabs a burger from that
`McDonald's <http://www.menuism.com/restaurant-locations/mcdonalds-21019>`__
outlet and sits to write. Googles throughout for search of a similar
code written elsewhere, copies and finishes the code. Tests it as per
the needs. Finds it satisfactory. Comments arbitrarily for
change-request and finally checks in. Happy to find the work being done.
Checks time, 10.30 PM. Takes his bag of items and repeats the horrendous
journey back home. Reaches home, turns on TV with his smartphone in
front of him for social networking updates and WhatsApp discussions.
12.30 AM and day ends.

Right. Why am I telling you this story? Well, for some reasons. Most
importantly about how the person spends his day throughout and ends up
nothing in his head. Being brilliant, he's unaware of the passing time
and eventually ends up working for longer hours. Why? Unwanted things
sneak in between and his code isn't his own to be proud of. So, let's
see how to optimize this to a practical extent.

1. `Social
Networking <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service>`__:
Guys, you're doing an amazing job. But it is hindering work via being
addicted to your updates! Remove the time spent and an amazingly high
amount of 2 hours gets into the pocket. Er.. on an average.

2. Feeds: Being upright with technology is fine, but not at the cost of
precious `work time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time>`__.
Another 3-4 hours of waste. Again, an average.

3. Code: Heck, that code your wrote might be awesome. But the
repercussions of it? Dependencies with other entities? Satisfactory
working with warnings as per told by the IDE is not good work. Remove
them too! Those warnings are actually signs of later disasters. How to
remove? See why that code gives warnings. IDEs are awesome in suggesting
things to work around. Communities post detailed discussions on such.
Try and see if you can put this to use.

4. Smartphone Activities: WhatsApp and G+, phenomenal utilities to stay
in touch. But ask yourself whether is that really necessary during work
hours.

Now I come to know, how `Andrew Ng <http://www.cs.stanford.edu/~ang>`__,
the `Machine Learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`__
guru and similar brilliant professors are productive rather than working
hard. They don't do any of the protagonist's activities!
