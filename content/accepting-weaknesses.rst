Weaknesses are an inbuilt quality for any person. Overcoming them is
quite a task but can be fruitful for the long run. If you can accept
that you can't be multi-tasking and focused at the same time on all of
them, it is better to accept the truth and move on.

Laying out goals of what you want to achieve can be a good lead to begin
with. And that's what I learnt. A bootstrapped/early-stage start-up is
not to begin your zeal with, unless you're a fresher. Your character is
sewed upon your first job and it's nature. If your job demands are
ruthless and dynamic, so will your career will be. If it is more of a
disciplined and streamlined way of work, like in any big organization,
you cannot adjust to the extremities of workloads all the time. Context
switching becomes deadly. It reduces your efficiency and reduces your
contribution overall.

That's what happens in a start-up. Things can go out of proportion and
the work surmounts to such a level that you might feel the end of days.
A small deviation can lead to an extra week of delivery delays. Some
simple tasks start to look big. A challenge in itself.

A well defined job role is my nature. And always was. Only that, I
ventured into the unknown of pushing myself into extremes. And boy, that
was hard!
