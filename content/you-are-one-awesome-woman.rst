A Church in the backwater regions of Kerala... The hero waits outside
seeing his heroine after a tough search. A fear remains, that she
wouldn't have excused him for the mistake he did the previous week. A
mistake, which men think for a umpteen number of times before revealing
it. A mistake, which a lady would be waiting for all her life to hear
for. A mistake which is exaggerated in movies so much that it is an
accustomed duty to ignore about.

The mistake ? Of simply letting her know that he is in love with her.
This makes our lady angry and she goes back to her granny's house in
God's country thinking that "he came to knew about her love towards
him". Now he is all around the place searching in churches for apology
of "hurriedly" letting his feelings about her. And apologizes in style
too, re-proposing once again, this time without any grievances and
becomes a friend. But this had something else in store.

On returning back to their home, he expresses his true feelings for her,
which, she doesn't obstruct and their friendship blossoms into real
love. She even tries to distance herself from him, but slowly she starts
to accept the reality that she cant live without him. This is somehow
leaked and both of their parents refuse straight away, specially from
the lady's side. Fearing consequences, the lady is now fickle minded to
the "fantastic chemistry" between them. Our hero doesn't give up that
easily either. He goes back to where she is now forcibly been married
and to his shock, finds the lady refusing the marriage right in front of
everyone. Who doesn't want to give his life for such a woman !

She finally accepts of being in love with him after a long battle of
talks and trips. Then the regular stuff of roaming together and all
happen.

One day, the hero invites her in his friend's house to talk. She is
scared and is finding herself in a dilemma as she is lying too much and
in unable to convince her parents about her relationship. "You just
convince your parents and I would show you how to live", was the hero's
reply.

Ahh.. Aaromale..........
