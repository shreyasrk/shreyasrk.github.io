The rain suddenly stopped. She was about to get drenched when the moist
filled her eyes. Of disappointment. Of agony. Of anger. Of hope. Of
rest.

| Rain, 
| Oh, you unknown train. 
| With wishes in a chain. 
| Lost in the terrain. 
| A chime of pain, 
| to clinch the sane. 
| Of misery and bane. 
| And a stain 
| thou 
| shall remain.

She wakes up to see the myriad ecstasy of silver bushes, soaked trees
and sliced clouds. A clove of saga, and a ranch of exaggeration. A
chirping peace and a quivering thought. To ask Him, why is this.. is
this.. this..
