Off late, I've been addicted to reading. Not to books. They are always
at bay when it comes to opening up my laptop. For them being the lone
companion which they excel at.

But my reading refers to the internet. The various links posted by
people on their profiles. Facebook. Twitter. G+. Blogger. Reader.
Reddit. You name it! And it all reasons to the level of following
patterns that you have.

Whom do we follow? Typically the ones whom we can identify ourselves..

| With tastes.
| With likes.
| With interests.
| With thoughts.
| With ideas.
| With passions.
| With habits.
| With behaviours.

Argh! We do. Even if we don't admit.

And how do we follow? Via the virtual world of invisible people, myriad
junkies and connected digital networks.

Alright. So now, we have a list. A list of people who we believe, can be
a mirror image of ourselves. And so pours in the various idiosyncrasies
of opinions, news and views. Tons of people. And thus, tons of views.
Tons of thoughts. Tons of blogs. Tons of styles. All of them sounding
sensible. And you start pondering over the clock on your desktop toolbar
wondering when the heck did it jump so fast.

You must be getting an idea of what am I talking about. If no, then
re-read this from above to follow completely. It just shows that you've
got insaner by the day.

Going further on the mayhem, take Facebook for example. Till the stupid
videos and photos appeared, it looked dumb. And now, after customizing
them to filter them out and show only reading links, the reading loop
repeats!

Oblivious to the fact that the workload increases exponentially. Yes!
Once the links are out on your browser, the urge to read them till the
final full stop never ceases and then yapping over to social sites to
check if your views matched with others. Beating round the bush, again!

And nowadays, weekends end up just scanning these all the way, leading
to loss of sleep time and the lovely television boredom movies which
you ritualized since you grew up. And we all wonder why Mondays appeared
sooner!

And now follows the usurping advice.

1. Curb down dailies and news sites: They gobble up on much of the
energy making you to think and start a small debate on some groups and
forums leading to a conclusion which, you could only synchronize with.
Tons of current affairs happen and you have quite a very large set
unless you choose smartly.

2. Tech Forums: These are the nastier lot. Most of the tech punks are
out there just to make news out of every crap they incur after
exercising their brains. Who cares if you need a button on your mobile
that can post links to sites which you are not even bothered looking at!
Anything that is significant in your line of work that could be
beneficial is a smarter choice!

3. Link posters: Another bunch of time wasters. I'm unable to imagine
the time they get to sit, read patiently amid their daily chores and
seek for a review! You start to feel laid back by such with the
knowledge they possess. Fact is, ignore them. It isn't worth the price
of your time.

To conclude, read when you have nothing in the world to do. Better to
shed when you have some prior goals set. And dedicate some time onto
them.

The links shall appear whenever you continue to track your statuses.

Whenever.
