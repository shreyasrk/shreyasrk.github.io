Damn it. I did it again. I fumbled again at another interview. Yet one
more goes down the drain. There are times when people's advises
constantly nag your head, "Be strong with the basics!" and that crap. I
made them prove they're true, yet another time.

When will I ever learn? From the constantly repeating mistakes. From the
false confidence thinking the work will pay off with the interview
discussions. From thinking of concerns not primary in the first case
like salary and acceptance.

People say to learn "basics". Let me break it down to what I've felt by
that word. Basics refer to basic entities, objects and things that are
foundations to a structure. You take a building to be built, then
bricks, mortar and cement are it's basics. Architectural Design, format
of the structure and blueprints arrive at a LATER stage. But
essentially, what you need are those simple three things to begin with,
right? And that's what interviewers are focused on to judge your
technical skills.

Juxtapose it to software development. Basics here, is an extremely hazy
topic. Why? The topics inside are huge, inter-related and extremely
confusing. Let me give my own example. Remember to always approach with
a top-to-bottom tree hierarchical situation in matters like these.

First, focus on the type of development you're assigned to - `Mobile
Computing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing>`__. What's
next in Mobile? - Environments. Then types in them? - Android, iOS,
Windows Phone and lesser known ones. I choose Android - open-source,
robust and no-money hassles. The type of Android development? -
Applications. Right, we now know where we are. Any further drills? -
Yes. Graphics, Multimedia, UI/UX Design, Security, Audio/Video/Image
Processing, Sensors, Networking, Kernel interactions, `Web
Apps <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application>`__ and so on. I had
no exposure to Game/Media processing development techniques. So, it
boils down to simple application development. Focus is now on pure UI/UX
Design, Components, Architecture fundamentals and Application Resources.

Is there a problem to study these in full detail? Even from the few
pages of content described on the Android Developers' web page? Or from
the internet with an even shorter-but-smarter explanations? Shame on me.
Really.

Ohh, and the two things of why I failed today:

#. Connectivity of theory to practice. Very poor. In fact, horrible. No
   wonder why, people who undergo training and then being deployed to
   projects are quite successful in handling various concepts wherever
   they go, whenever they need.
#. Conceptual Use-cases. You have a situation in hand and you don't know
   the fundamental concept right when you're asked about it. And you
   fail. Miserably, hopelessly. And sit there like a fool. Even in the
   simplest of situations and silliest of basics involved.

Most importantly, the biggest of all hindrances is the ego. Ego of not
being able to answer questions. Ego of being hurt by a person. Ego of
not being accepted. Ego of thinking about sequences unrelated to the
ongoing context. Ego of a nature, devouring the self. LET GO OF ALL
THIS!!

Interviewers are plain human. In fact, they were pleased to answer
questions which I fumbled or didn't know about. And I learned some basic
traits. To share. To apply. To know the basics. TO ASK!

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag's "Zinda.." being played in background beams an
age-old suggestion, "Preparation and persistence is the combined key."
Keep studying and studying, as interviews aren't exam dates to flush
them out over and forget them at all. It's a constant learning process.
 You just cannot ignore the two sides of a coin.

So,  if you're into a domain, learn it's fundamentals first, even though
it might sound boring and avoidable. Practice will wait. True that you
will get a chance again to prove. But why screw up this ongoing
opportunity?

Pssst.. Stolen from a job post ad! This has something to do with what I
scribbled above. Hope you can connect the dots.

-  Dream big about your work and execute even bigger.
-  Think working meaningful hours is always better than just working
   long hours.
-  Jack of many trades and master of one. Say no to nothing.
-  Persistence. It’s OK to get stuck, not OK to give up.
-  Believe in yourself and people around you.
-  Ethics and respect for work, workplace and team mates.
