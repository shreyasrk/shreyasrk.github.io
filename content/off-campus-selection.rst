Ha.. Finally I started to work. This feels like dream because it
satisfies my wishes and all that crapo which you dont wanna read!
Anyways, let me start with my experiences.

First things first. I wanted to work because I was sick of studying
more. Then came the prestige thing, which is more of weird now that
satisfied my ego then. Somehow, I managed to sneak into a company that
was paying a decent one for a newly graduated guy. But the real trouble
came after I finished my graduation.

I came to realize that most of the companies dint had much of work for
freshers and joining dates started to postpone. This gave me goosebumps
in my stomach since I had seen my seniors join immediately after they
graduated. Lucky they, but ours was the worst case since many companies
did not participate for the placement programs because of some internal
problems. This propelled me to take the path of an Off-campus
recruitment procedure. And worse had to come yet!

The outside world is a real, big, bad one. You may be having the best of
potentials but what all matters in the end is your luck factor. But
never stop trying! This pushed me to write some of the companies, most
of them without a reference. And yes,this reference thing does a huge
job as well as this is where you can push your seniors to help you a
little bit and that really helps. So, I tried with such paths as well.

Nothing seems to be on my way.I was thrown out in first round or not
even called at all when I saw light at the end of the tunnel.
Fortunately, I was short listed to write in one of such things. Things
went off so smoothly that I dint even feel happy about that offer letter
i got in my hands.

That letter! The most precious letter ever!

Sounds strange, but this is what I felt. For most of those geeks, it is
a routine job to find a job but this is where your actual life starts,
yaar! And the life thereafter will shape up your future. Studying might
help you get a better pack but you have to start with the same criteria
called experience!

And yeah,even if you dont get one, be cool. You will get one for sure.
Everybody has his accounts in His bank!
