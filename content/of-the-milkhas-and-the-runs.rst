It was December, 2012. A Facebook News feed run stopped at a video. The
video was shared with a status of being 'highly anticipated'. A click,
and then an inspiration followed. The video was the trailer of a movie
of a soldier who is a true inspiration in motivation, hard work and
focus. It was the story of Milkha Singh.

Come May 2013, and the second trailer beams in a dull component of the
story teller. It showed more of how the athlete faces circumstances in
his life with a broken screenplay. The anticipation stayed, hoping of
breaking it loose in the movie. This time, Farhan Akhtar, to be
instilling more hope from the plot.

And the day arrived. July, 2013. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag was finally out in
the public. Initial hopes made people impatient and made them scurried
around for reviews. The anticipations came crashing down with the
viewers terming it as a "lengthy, stretch" and advices to muster up
enough patience to sit through. I moved on, thinking of catching this
gem in the internet someday.

Guess, it wasn't meant to be.

Yesterday, a friend rings up and books tickets. I resist. He says to
mute people's verdicts and just come along for the fun of it. I get
ready and reach the venue. Besides chomping a heavy lunch, I warned him
that if it gets boring, my stomach would speak up to crash right there.
He ignored. And then the movie began.

And it didn't disappoint. One. Single. Frame.

For the Milkha Singh it showed. For the Milkha Singh that symbolizes
perseverance. Milkha Singh of dedication, deviance, focus and winning.
Milkha Singh of dispute, rebel, strength and survival. Milkha Singh of
bonding, love, care and responsibility. Milkha Singh of pain, tears,
fights and silence.

The plot is gripping until the intermission folds up. Partly agreeing
with the crowd's verdicts, the second half does makes itself feel
unnecessary, apart from certain important incidents. Quietly surprised
with the take of kissing on screen, nevertheless admiring that pin-drop
of silence observed in the theatre in that instant. And finally,
audience clapping when Milkha Singh flies across the track beating his
counterpart by an unthinkable margin.

Farhan Akhtar has a class body. His acting skills are a natural,
surpassed to an extent impossible to judge any more. Pavan Malhotra as
Farhan's mentor stands apart. The tears in his eyes when Milkha hands
over his accolades is priceless. Sonam Kapoor er.. lets leave it at
that. It was a gist to prick out Milkha's emotional quotient. Meesra
Shafi, unwanted. Prakash Raj, a surprise package. Ranvir Singh, India's
coach could've been more inspirational than funny in Ladakh.

Watch Bhaag Milkha.. for nothing but that one single scene. When Milkha
runs amid a grieve injury. You'll eventually know why he became India in
that.
