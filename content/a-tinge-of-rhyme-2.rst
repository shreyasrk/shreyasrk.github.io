To the heart, it sounded the same. To the mind, a wave it became. A
churn of ice, mixed with fire. Passes through everyday, like a tinge of
pyre.

Who knew that experience is a bird, who can wake up the sunrise and
flows to cheer? Who knew that experience can be worthwhile, and
sometimes just a tidal splash otherwise?

Who knew that a sprinkle of fun could just refresh those eyes and make
them realize, the world is just a prize? Who can tell that the daily
splurge of life, can be something you can cherish with some strife?

A body so exposed, it ceases to be transposed, to the simple things
juxtaposed, with a complexity superimposed, of the secrets
undisclosed and a pain unopposed.

To the mistakes decomposed with it's learning enclosed. A new chapter
reimposed, off a hook slightly nosed, turns its way posed to give a new
feel foreclosed.

PS: Beginning to hate Wordpress as it couldn't convert the above lines
to poetic style.
