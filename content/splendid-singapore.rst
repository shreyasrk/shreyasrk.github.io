Jan, 2011. When the feeling of staying away from home for the first time
sunk in. Foreign land, foreign faces and a foreign culture. A foreign
taste in desi food which makes the mind yearn back to the homeland,
missing all the spicy food and sweet-meats. A restless mind, insane
thoughts and a lonely feeling, came all at once.

Aug, 2013. Same feeling. But on the other side. Leaving Singapore. The
feelings have changed. Respect has swelled. Life has been better. And
freedom to reminiscence. A place that taught the value of hard-work,
importance of reality and a humility to stay on ground with failures and
successes like the seasons. A place free from noise, interference and
temperament. A place, perfect for a noob to prosper.

I shall be missing Singapore for sure. For the genuine friends it gave,
the value of gratefulness, the ability to believe in people and the
importance of decisions. For the hard work it teaches, the survival
phases that you enter into, the constant adjustments with nincompoops
and ignorance of things. For the importance of saving, the respect it
gave due to distance and the feeling of being loved. For the happiness
it showered after tears of ill-fate, joy after the hours of effort and
maturity after experiences of life.

You rarely get such a chance to Â discover yourself. Thank you,
Singapore!
