Its 12.45 AM into a cold weekend holiday. To the lush cool breeze
outside the balcony of my house, sitting on a long armchair with rains
tinkling in between, a sleep fades away.

Wish I had someone to be my side today. Listen to her voice, soft as the
gentle rain dew. Hold her hand, feeling the warmth in them. Walk with
her, removing the loneliness inside. Talk to her blurting out the mayhem
within. Laugh with her, re-living the being in ourselves. And make her
doze off on my shoulder..

The night seem to be incomplete though..
