Someone on Twitter posted a question to suggest places in Bangalore
where a person can take long walks - of talk, thoughts or of silence.
Putting some choices of mine below:

-  Margosa Road, Malleshwaram: The entire stretch from 18th Cross mini
   bus depot all the way to 5th Cross underpass is a serene walk. Lush
   trees with 90s-style buildings throng the place. Don't forget to
   barge into some famous eateries along the way.
-  M N Krishna Rao Park, Basavanagudi: The oldest of South Bangalore's
   famous walk through. You just want to stay there for some more time.
-  Streets of Rajajinagar: Either from Navrang theatre all the way to
   Shell Petrol Bunk or the journey southwards till Sujatha junction, it
   is a nostalgic drive. Don't pick the main roads and navigate via the
   more silent and calmer 1st Block streets.
-  Seshadripuram College: Everybody's aware of the Pani Puri junction in
   front of the college, but the road parallel to the railway tracks is
   a brilliant option to self-introspect.
-  Sankey Tank: Pick up a bench or just walk round the tank area with
   water accompanying your journey either way.
-  Rashtreeya Vidyalaya Road: Begin from South End Circle opposite the
   City Library and finish all the way south to Sangam Circle. That
   single road is enough to delve you into thinking.
-  J P Nagar 6th Phase: I mean the streets parallel to 100 feet Ring
   Road ones. Posh locality, lush greenery and lesser traffic, you
   shouldn't skip this one.
-  Chord Road, Vijayanagar: Right from the Bus Stop all the way to
   Magadi Road Junction, you will even encounter a few local
   green-hubs in between to have a break.
-  Indiranagar: Opposite to Krishna Sweets lies a park where you might
   find the calmest peace anyone can in Bangalore itself. Ask for it.
-  Banaswadi: From Kammanahalli junction into the market area. Stop for
   some chats along if you can.
-  Sajjan Rao Circle: This one is a food-cum-serene place. Dive into
   Chat Street (although I gave it up owing to poor food quality) or
   take a long walk all the way to Arumugam Circle (a single road
   connects both of them, ask for directions).

Seemed like this site was dead until a memoir of reminiscence struck
along.
