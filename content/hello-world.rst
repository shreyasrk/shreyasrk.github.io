Ohh.. I mean the wordpress world ! Just editing the template provided by
the website for the Hello, World category. Was bored of blogspot (Sorry,
Google !) and thus, shifting for a change.

By the way, just to introduce myself, the profile wont be of much help.
My posts would be the more "definitive" of me. Was and in the verge of
learning new stuffs and wordpress caught my eye for now.

I do blog, not often though. Not on topics which are hot favorite, but
on the ones that touch me, my life and my heart. So it might be a tad
boring to a few nevertheless, but would certainly try to improve. Your
comments would be highly encouraging.

To begin with, the idea of writing filled in my mind seeing people. Yes
! People inspire me a lot, quite a lot. I have seen people doing
something or the other in their pages with some brilliant stuffs of what
the mind can do. Be it in taking scintillating pictures, writing some
great words or reading some solid good stuff to name a few.

The thought of reading also clicks, maybe not often, but it still is and
is more inspiring. Assimilating them in a blog requires a considerable
amount of time,effort and is quite appreciating. So here is to all the
people, a big Thank You !

Why to blog? Some people put in some motivation for me to write more
based on previous attempts, but the topics that I think of are stupid
enough. Quite stupid! But who cares, right? So here goes my blogathon.
Hope I find more inspirations and more followers.

I dont have an extraordinary vocabulary and so this might look quite
simple enough.

To finally end this post, never stop learning and do the best thing that
gives a vibe in you, as per the legendary Steve Jobs. May the world see
more such in the future !
