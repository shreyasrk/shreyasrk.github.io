<p>In <a href="/category/uncategorized.html">Uncategorized</a>. </p>
</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>One lazy Saturday afternoon and there pops up a link from a friend to
watch &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_26">Special Chabbis</a>&quot;,
the latest of the series from the coveted <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Pandey">Neeraj
Pandey</a>. After becoming a
fan of the execution of the recent sleeper hit, &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.awednesdaythefilm.com/">A
Wednesday</a>&quot;, there was an
eagerness to see how Mr. Pandey-ji thinks. And ahoy, he amazes to the
core!</p>
<p>This movie is a special touch from Pandey. A heist, never explored and
is almost foolproof, is the subject topic from Pandey-ji's stables. The
screenplay and the casting give it a neat icing, not to forget some
mistakes that could be overlooked, like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajal_Aggarwal">Kajal
Agarwal</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Himesh%2BReshammiya">Himesh
Reshammiya</a>'s nosy
songs. When the plot was this power-packed, the entertainment was enough
to engage, no?</p>
<p>Let us turn to 1987, when
<a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=18.975,72.8258333333&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=18.975,72.8258333333%20(Mumbai)&amp;t=h">Mumbai</a>
was still, Bombay. I was looking for one blooper where the dialogue
would mention the new name to please the current fundamentalists, but
was unsuccessful. Some persons faking themselves as investigating
officials from the Central government, loot the house whom they term it
as a &quot;raid&quot; and disappear to their hives, only to turn up somewhere else
to begin the process over and over. This suddenly gets reported to the
&quot;real&quot; officials who then, plot a hatch to hack them out. And that's the
movie is all about.</p>
<p>When you realize that this could be a boring movie, that's when
Pandey-ji's pen strikes to blow your head off. In order to accomplish
their &quot;final&quot; plot, the fakers use the real ones in their plan to loot
the famous Opera House jewellery store. This case is a real-reported one
where 26 people, posed as officers of the crime branch, loot the same
store and escape, only to leave the people shocked. Pandey-ji gives a
beautiful twist to see that the main characters don't loose sheen and
the story becomes a well-plotted, cunning and a brilliantly organized,
intelligent masterpiece.</p>
<p>Coming to the performances, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/anupam_kher">Anupam
Kher</a> is the
best. Playing the dumb, timid man of the gang but is actually outlying
the real ones isn't an easy task. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/akshay_kumar">Akshay
Kumar</a> was
good. He couldâ€™ve been more subtle and lively than his &quot;Khiladi&quot;
seriousness. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/manoj-bajpai">Manoj
Bajpai</a> is
perfect for the real officer who is sharp, brave and wise for the job.
Like I mentioned, Kajal Agarwal and the songs weren't needed and why is
an unknown <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeru_Bajwa">Neeru Bajwa</a>
giving a guest appearance in a song so unrelated to the sequence? Flaws
are there, but like I said, when the story delivers, these can be
ignored.</p>
<p>My weekend was a superb one this time.</p>
