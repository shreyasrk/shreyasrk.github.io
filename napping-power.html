</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><p>A long day and a load of tasks to do. You get up early in the morning,
do the chores and then set out. One task after another, you keep on
doing them but at one point, the brain gives up. Only then you realize
that you need a break. That is when the power nap comes in as a remedy.</p>
</p><p>For my regular habit of dozing for three hours in the afternoon siesta,
this came as a handy tool to refresh. The mind is&nbsp;so much&nbsp;preoccupied
with the list, that you forget that you need a pause. And to top the
tasks would be a lecture not to be afforded to miss, for the tiny things
that are missed out in slides which come handy during examination and
some of your job interviews, that is when the brain tries to doze if the
lecture isn't going interesting. You have to stay awake, else someone
would take note of the points and zooms ahead of you. That is when the
power nap comes in as a remedy.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to me yesterday. With my regular 12 hour day
job, I had a good sleep the night before. After a long morning of
reading blogs and studying notes of the earlier lectures, lunch awaited.
Resuming after, I hurried to the library to borrow some recommended
books for learning passion, being the reader in me to keep up my newly
found habit. Checking the regular NewsFeed on my Facebook and trying to
dive into the concepts of Android development, I surged. With such
constant inputs all the time, the mind slows to reciprocate. If we try
to continue, you tend to skip some few important things in hand. So, I
thought of trying a short nap to see the enormous power that it brings
in, having read many articles on the same.</p>
<p>Napping eases out the tensions just like reading a book, only that the
mind thinks of nothing else.&nbsp;The only criteria of such a nap is, to doze
for a very short amount of time until the mind enters a state of calm.
It takes a maximum of an hour for the brain to get stabilized and the
body pain to dwindle. But, we tend to start liking the relaxed state,
often forgetting that we still have the remaining long day to pass
through. And thus, we doze off with a elongated siesta, turning things
haywire.</p>
<p>A method to be used in case of a tiring day, this worked wonders as it
did for me. I was able to concentrate at the lecture thereafter and was
not even blinking for a slightest moment thinking of the tiredness.</p>
