</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>If you feel that&nbsp;Kannada cinema is dying or Kannada cinema has lost it's
old touch&nbsp;or&nbsp;Kannada people don't have that ability to deliver
excellence, think again.</p>
<p>Rakshit Shetty of &quot;ಸಿಂಪಲ್ ಆಗಿ ಒಂದ್ ಲವ್ ಸ್ಟೋರಿ&quot; fame has some surprises
in the bag. The director in him surpasses his previous acting abilities
as he binds the story in a frame rarely found in Kannada cinema. An
&quot;experiment&quot; as he says, has knocked out regular, boring movie
masala&nbsp;out of the windows. All you can see is sultry presence of talent
and brilliance all over.</p>
<p>The movie has a regular story - a series of murders that happened in the
coastal area of Malpe. But the difference lies in people, who is a part
of it tell their own perspective of the story. All you need is a proper
string that binds them together. In the end, you'd realize
that&nbsp;everything is relative.</p>
<p>Cinematography caught my attention as soon as the movie began. Depicting
the same scene&nbsp;in all angles is the toughest part and&nbsp;not even a single
flaw could be found to prick&nbsp;the discontinuity. Another rare feature was
the varied camera work, like the photographer's mind. A lens in the eyes
of the brain depicts things extremely focused, like the part where Raghu
escapes with the bag, Achyut Kumar finding the prized possession or the
&quot;huli dance&quot;. It became so clear that the brain understands what is
ongoing and not about it's surroundings.</p>
<p>With mind-blowing screenplay, the movie reaches a new level. The way how
the dots connect is difficult to comprehend unless you are carefully
observing, is a stunning feature found in the film. With a novel-based
approach depicting the incident as chapters, the director then tries to
segment every chapter with the character in play and his role. A chapter
also attaches it's own significance - be it the humorous part of Richie,
the motherly sentiment of Tara or the love of Kishore. Every chapter
depicts as a whole as well as a part. Wow!</p>
<p>And the background music outperforms the expectations. Every scene has a
unique flavor of the music connected to it's chapter and is extremely
hooking to your seat. The introductory part was the most eye-catching.
The boring introduction is chucked out and in comes a fresh way to tell
how the film should be opened.</p>
<p>Overall, every department has given their unique best to delve out
&quot;ಉಳಿದವರು ಕಂಡಂತೆ&quot;. Rakshit Shetty and his extremely-talented team have
given a quality film, much longer to be remembered and learn from.</p>
<p>A must watch!</p>
