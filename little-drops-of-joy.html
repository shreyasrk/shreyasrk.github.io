</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It was late for me from my office to reach home one day. Reason ? The
cursing rainfall of Bangalore roads, which are filled with water,
drenching you up when a car zooms by, reaches the inner part of your
spectacles when the helmet doesn't have a plastic guard which troubles
the most important part of the journey, driving ! But what excited me
before the starting point is the fact, how this stupid rainfall can
really catch your eyes.</p>
<p>It was 15 minutes to 6P.M one day and I noticed thick, black clouds
roaming over the office signing a terrible output in the end. Poor, Lazy
and dull head of mine, I never got up from my seat, relishing
deliciously made Masala Puri in the canteen with friends. But when I
actually got up, trouble started. I just reached my cubicle to pick up
my bag (which has nothing but a phone and purse to store.. what an info
! ) and headed straight away to the parking yard to get my bike. I
really wanted to escape this mess which will happen later for sure. But
Nature had its own timing.</p>
<p>As I zoomed past the yard, it started to pour up. I had no option but to
park as I didn't had raincoats / any safe equipment to do with. And
then, i noticed how rain really mesmerizes you.</p>
<p>When it rains, and that too, after a very long time, you really want to
get drenched into it. The downpour was very much, inviting. The dance of
the trees to the flow of rain sounded like a singing group in a church
showed in films, swinging and enjoying. The wind sweeps the clouds which
diverts the water that makes it a trail of remains. Everything wet and
really eye catching. Everybody justs runs to a shade to find some
shelter and that excitement of running itself is something special. You
are very much desperate to do something which I find missing in myself !</p>
<p>Overall, the Bangalore rains cause trouble on the roads for drivers but
it is certainly a good treat to do with and not part whatsoever.</p>
