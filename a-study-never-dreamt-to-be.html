</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Singapore, was thought of as a country similar to the western world, as
a provider of studies and opportunities. The latter part is yet to be
experienced of, but the former part was a thing not to be forgotten
either.</p>
<p>Studies are an integrated part of a student life. Much to it was of the
thought of studying and getting to college accustoms. Agree that they
cannot be deprived of their requirement, but owing to improper planning
and a hurried decisive behaviour, it all turned haywire.</p>
<p>The university is very much demanding of its students, of the fact that
of its vision to be Asia's numero uno centre for learning. Ignorant of
this fact, the fact of &quot;usual&quot; easy-to-go student life style still
hovered in my mind, unknown to the taxing of what was lying ahead of.
Sincere respect to the flexibility of the course that it has to offer
to, but improper planning has turned everything bizarre in my case.</p>
<p>To begin with, to the horror of my inexperience of the subjects to be
chosen for my study, I shuffled between six to seven classes per week to
&quot;decide&quot; on my electives to be chosen. Finally I chose four of them,
checking their examinations which would be held in the fourth month of
the semester, incidentally the last days of that semester ! And then,
the maniac started..</p>
<p>Assignments, Mid-term examinations and quizzes. Not to forget a recess
break in between, which cannot be held into account of its presence,
owing to the heavy work load in front of us. Thinking that a subject
taught along with a mini project in the sideways will prove to be better
completely screwed my plans out in flat. I did a mistake of choosing
three of such ones which I suffered heavily in the last few fortnights
of the examination deadlines. Some outputs submitted are crazy, some are
down the drain and some in between the right and the wrong expectations.
But had to do this keeping in mind the buffer of the examination study
and the projects consideration for overall assessment.</p>
<p>And then, the exams arrived. To the surprise, all the questions had to
be attempted, a side unaware to us as we were led to choices all the
times ! And the questions amounted to a maximum of four per subject
which included the entire learning in them. Now thats what I call
preparation. But all should end well when the results arrive. Lets hope
for the best !</p>
