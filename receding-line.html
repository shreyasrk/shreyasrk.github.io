</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><p>Wow! Is what plainly describes the new&nbsp;exoneration. The new inscribe. A
feeling of a hidden despair vanishing in a flash. And what a change, it
has brought in too.</p>
</p><p>After a medication advice from a practitioner, it felt like going under
the knife. The receding line was clearly visible and was nearly total
when a recent intimation happened. Perplexed by the ugly getup it
portrayed, hurrying through the buses and ending up at a salon.</p>
<p>The salon was quite exquisite. With leather-cushioned seats, adjustable
heights and a kit load of accessories to operate with. And hosts,
uncountable. Spikes- for the men and women alike, it looked like a shrub
with no grass cut ever in its tenure. White makeups, scissors in their
pockets and a black robe to cover the dirt that sprayed onto them with a
welcome message splashed. It was luxurious for the air-conditioning
service pre-installed in the salon and on the customer's pocket. Beams
of drying equipment, trimmers and cash counters blocked the paths. All
of a sudden, a lady bangs open the door and orders me to sit on the
decorated chairs. Like a stuffed goat, ready to be axed.</p>
<p>Innocent me, obeyed as ordered. And then zip-zap-zoom! Two clothes of
towels quickly engulfed the chest. And a coat for the same dirt to fall
on. I had an intention this time. To cover up the receding line as well
as show it up in a cult fashion. And then came up the trimmer onto my
head. Of course, before the custom of asking the style that you need.
Which, at first instance, I didn't know about.</p>
<p>The line started to disappear and emerged a partly flashy skin,
ridiculous with the companions around. Not withstanding the stupid look,
I suggested her to continue trimming it up and closed my eyes. After
three rounds of the electronic instrument over the head, it finally
stopped. I opened my eyes after the weird look and found to my surprise,
a neat and clean head, not to worry about. Not to doubt on. Happy on the
choice made. And a emergence of attitude.</p>
<p>Posting a snapshot of the new look, I amazed myself more. With the
global acceptance and&nbsp;likable&nbsp;feature, I swelled up more with pride.
With a paltry sum charged amid wonders.</p>
