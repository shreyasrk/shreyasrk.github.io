</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>After a long stint of personal (and private) conversations, let us move
to something more generic and informative. This post is about those
things that are (usually) found in job ads in most of the start-ups,
small and big companies and the news sites all over.</p>
<p>Imagine you've a hardware instrument that is constantly supplying
information. Now, there comes a point where in, you want to track this.
Well, that is now possible via the Internet-of-Things. All it requires
is sensible and reliable data collection. Stage-1. Be a good programmer
in Embedded systems, C and interfacing to a software entity and this can
be a huge field to play with.</p>
<p>But what if you want to digitize this information and keep it so that
you could delve more information out of it? What if you, at a later
stage find out that this same old data is now able to give you valuable
inputs and can cut down/zoom your productivity? What if you find that a
simple interpretation can ease things in the later stages, determining
the device's future itself? Internet-of-Things Stage-2, for the answer.
The data collected can now be pushed to central repositories on a
remotely hosted Cloud that can then be used to do whatever data-analysis
you wanted to achieve.</p>
<p>Now that you understood how data is important, can you now visualize
this interpreted data into an user interface? Can you show this data
into useful pictorial representation which can then make users see the
ongoing patterns based on their data inputs? Will you go beyond the
usual thinking of viewing data and now, compose data out of data? Well,
Internet-of-Things Stage-3 A.K.A UI/UX is the field for you. A good
programming exposure in node.js, JavaScript and some frameworks like
backbone.js, ember.js and angular.js can lead you to a lot of companies
that are currently dealing with this concept.</p>
<p>Internet-of-Things has various technologies for you. Becoming a
full-stack developer is in high demand as most companies require people
with exposure to various technologies and can solve the whole problem in
one go.&nbsp;Various Hardware start-ups are now into the foreplay to provide
more customer productivity and saving most of the undesired tasks. They
are now cutting down on precious resources which otherwise laid a huge
bill on customers' wallets.&nbsp;Also, this is the latest fad among VCs in
the Silicon Valley too (as per a
Quora&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.quora.com/How-does-a-startup-get-picked-up-by-Google">answer</a>).</p>
<p>Okay, you don't seem to be interested in either. But what about that
little device in your pocket which you play games, keep reminders,
talk/chat people, read articles and what not? Smart-phone application
development hasn't (surprisingly) lowered in demand. With more
technological achievements in the mobile domain and the advent of
building user-specific phones, developers in such fields are challenged
to all of the concepts - UI/UX, APIs, data feed and ideas. Be a good
developer in Android/Java, iOS/Obj-C with some additional web frameworks
like PhoneGap, Sencha and Appcelerator, and you don't get out of work.</p>
<p>Embedded Systems, Back-end Infrastructure, Front-End Data Analytics and
Mobile Programming. That's the thing going on this year. As far as I'm
seeing it.</p>
